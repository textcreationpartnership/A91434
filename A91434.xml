            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader,</hi> it is certain, that the Interpretation of a great part of Prophecies, dependeth on a juſt and due accommodation of the numbers of the yeers. But the numbers are various, the <hi>1290, 1260, 490, 1000, 2300.</hi> To ſet beginning and end to one of theſe, without relation to the reſt, and ſo to run at large, is eaſie. But we are confined. And ſuch terms of beginning and end, muſt be to one as will be ſuteable to the terms of all the reſt: Which is a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing to diſcover. Two wayes of accommodation I have eſpied, agreeable to all numbers, which in this Diſcourſe I have propoſed to conſideration. The former doth bring in the end of the reign of Antichriſt, and the beginning of the glory of <hi>New-Jeruſalem,</hi> about the yeer <hi>1650:</hi> The other way, about the yeer <hi>1860,</hi> that is, above <hi>200</hi> yeers hence, as ſhall be ſhewed in the Diſcourſe. Which of theſe two is to be choſen, I am not able at preſent to determine. Two or three yeers more of experience would have ſhewed which way to ſteer. Willingly therefore would I have ſtayed a little longer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had publiſhed any of my thoughts concerning Prophecies, that I might have been inſtructed to write more ſurely and punctually, and without ſuch uncertain and proble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical manner of diſcourſe as now I muſt be forced unto: But I am not to look at my own ends, neither am I to ſerve my ſelf, but Chriſt and the Church: Wherefore <hi>Chriſtian Reader,</hi> accept at my hands what I do communicate in this writing; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring and ſeeking therein the benefit of <hi>Sion.</hi> I would have preſented it more elaborate; but my weakneſſe and occaſions bindered. Tydings I bring of ſad times, and tydings of great joy to follow after. My ſpirit hath been grieved to declare the former: But I muſt be faithful, and declare the whole Truth according to my judgement. Nevertheleſſe, what is the affliction to the glory ſucceeding? If the time of the end be not yet come, we may, look for an eaſier affliction, and every day expect deliverance: But then the Reſtauration following will be onely greater then before, not perfect. If the time of the end be come, then we muſt expect and prepare for the ſad time of the three yeers and half yet future, <hi>Apoc. 11.8.</hi> and then perfect Reſtauration will follow after, to be compleated in (hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly perfections. I determine nothing in this point. Read and judge, and make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as God ſhall pleaſe to move. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

               <div n="1" type="part">
                  <head>The Controverſal part.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He main Controverſie in this Viſion, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Iron feet and legs, and the ſtone that ſmote them. The opinion of ſome is, that they ſignifie the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> in the Grecian Kingdom, and eſpecially the <hi>Seleucidae:</hi> and the ſtone cut out of the mountain, Chriſt at his firſt coming, and his Spiritual Kingdom following.</p>
                  <p>This cannot ſtand,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe every metal ſignifieth a diſtinct King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the fulneſſe and complement thereof, from the beginning to the perfect end: and therefore the Brazen belly and thighs, are the whole and perfect Grecian kingdom; and accordingly the legs and feet of Iron do ſignifie another kingdom diſtinguiſhed from the Grecian, which cannot be the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and other Succeſſors in the ſame kingdom. For as the Golden head doth ſignifie the whole Babylonian kingdom, the Silver breſt the whole Perſian; ſo the Brazen belly and thighs the whole Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, including the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and other Succeſſors in the ſame kingdom. For theſe make up the integrity and fulneſſe of the Grecian kingdom, as much as the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113414:3"/>of <hi>Nebuchad-nezzar</hi> make up the integrity of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian, or as much as the Succeſſors of <hi>Cyrus</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the perfect conſtitution of the Perſian. And ſo when the Grecian kingdom is propoſed, Chap. 8.21, 22, it is expreſly deſcribed as conſtituted, not onely of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> the Great, but alſo the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and other the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in the ſame kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe this Viſion muſt reach unto the laſt days, Chap. 2.28; which could not be, if the leggs and feet, the extreme and utmoſt part of the Image, ſhould end in the <hi>Seleucidae;</hi> foraſmuch as this kingdom expired before the birth of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe the leggs are ſaid to be of Iron, in compariſon of the parts and kingdoms going before, which were of weaker metal: whereas the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and other Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander,</hi> had not the ſtrength of <hi>Alexander.</hi> Chap. 8.21, 22. Thou wilt ſay, The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is repreſented by Iron, onely in relation to the Church, whereunto it was more terrible then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. I reply, 1. As the two firſt kingdoms are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by unequal Metals, the firſt of Gold, the ſecond of Silver, to note an abſolute inferiority of the one unto the other, Chap. 2.39: ſo by proportion, the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Braſſe and Iron, to note an abſolute imparity in ſtrength, between the later and the former. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iron kingdom muſt be abſolutely and in it ſelf ſtronger then the Brazen, and not onely in reſpect of particular exerciſe and employment of its ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the people of the Church. 2. The Iron king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is expreſly ſaid to be as Iron, becauſe it bruiſed all theſe, that is, the former kingdoms; and not becauſe more terrible to the Jews, Verſ. 40. 3. Becauſe it is the ſame with the fourth Beaſt, with the Iron teeth, Chap. 7.7; which is therefore ſo repreſented, becauſe it devoured
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113414:3"/>the whole earth, and not the Jews onely, Chap. 7.23. 4. Becauſe <hi>Nebuchad-nezzar</hi> and <hi>Haman</hi> in the former Kingdoms, were more formidable to the Jews then the <hi>Seleucidae;</hi> and therefore there is no reaſon that in this reſpect the fourth kingdom ſhould be repreſented by Iron, in compariſon of the former kingdoms, as ſtronger and more terrible then thoſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in the days of theſe kings, ſhall the God of heaven ſet up the Kingdom of his Son: whereas the kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and the whole Greek Empire was utterly diſſolved before the birth of Chriſt, Verſ. 44.</p>
                  <p>Neither can the ſtone that ſmote the Image be Chriſt at his firſt coming, and his Kingdom immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing unto the end;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe the kingdom ſignified by the ſtone, muſt break in pieces all the other kingdoms: whereas the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and kingdoms going before, did not ſtand until the birth of Chriſt, to be broken down by his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom following: and were as broken down before, ſo by another kingdom, the power of the Romans.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe if they had continued till after the birth of Chriſt, yet his Kingdom that was and is between his firſt and ſecond Coming, was not appointed for the breaking down of all earthly kingdoms: this being the time of the Gentiles, Luke 21.24, and for the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to reign, and for the Church to be troden under foot, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.2, 15.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe the kingdom here ſpoken of, doth break in pieces all other kingdoms; ſo that thoſe being utterly extinct, this alone doth ſtand in place of them, Verſ. 44. Now this ſtate is not to be expected under the kingdom of Patience, or before the fall of Antichriſt, when the kingdoms of the earth ſhall be the Lords and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113414:4"/>his Chriſts, and he ſhall reign for evermore, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.15, 18.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, what prerogative and advancement had it been for the Kingdom of Chriſt Spiritual, to have broken down the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and other horns of the Greek Empire, as long as another kingdom, the kingdom of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, ſucceeded in their place, to beat down the Church by the Heathen Emperours and Antichriſt, for longer ſpace of time, and with greater and more terrible perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution then ever was before?</p>
                  <p>Contrarily I affirm, that the leggs, feet and toes of Iron, do ſignifie the Romane kingdom:</p>

                  <p>FOur Metals do conſtitute the Image: Gold; Silver, Braſſe, Iron.

The two Silver arms, the two arms of the Monarchy, The <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> Chap. 8.1, 2, 3. The third Metal, Braſſe, conſtituting the belly and thighs, The third Monarchy, which is the Grecian. The belly noteth the beginning and greatneſſe of this kingdom; under <hi>Alexander</hi> the firſt King. The joynts between the belly and thighs, note the plucking up of this kingdom after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death, to be divided into four, whereof the principal were two, the one of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> the other of the <hi>Lagidae,</hi> figured here by the two thighs of Braſſe. See Chap. 11.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Metal of Iron, conſtituting the leggs, feet and toes, ſignifieth the fourth, which is the Romane king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The two leggs do note the diviſion of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into the Empire of the Eaſt, and the Empire of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113414:5"/>Weſt, firſt begun by <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtabliſhed by <hi>Conſtantine, anno</hi> 330, and again more perfectly by <hi>Theodoſius, anno</hi> 395.</p>
                  <p>At the ancles there is a joynt dividing between the leggs and feet, to note the interciſion of the Empire by the Northern <hi>Barbarians.</hi> By theſe the Romane Empire was diſſolved and broken into ten kingdoms, here ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the ten toes. They began effectually to invade the Empire after <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> and ceaſed not until they had disjoynted it into ten parts: which came to paſſe upon the death of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the third, about the yeer 455.
<note place="margin">Clav.

                  <p>Of theſe feet and toes, or ten kingdoms in the divided Empire, three things are propoſed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that hereby the Romane Empire ſhould be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Verſ. 41, in theſe words:—<hi>And whereas thou ſamest the feet and toes part of Potters Clay and part of Iron, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall be divided.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that ſome of theſe kingdoms ſhould be weak and tranſient, ſome of them ſtrong and permanent. This is expreſſed, Verſ. 41, 42, in theſe words: <hi>But there ſhall be in it of the ſtrength of the Iron, foraſmuch as thou ſaweſt the Iron mixt with miry Clay: And as the toes of the feet were part of Iron and part of Clay; ſo the kingdom ſhall be partly ſtrong and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113414:5"/>partly brittle.</hi> The <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and divers others, proved brittle, quickly diſſolved; but the Irony ſtrength appeared in the <hi>Franks,</hi> by whom the Empire was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Image of its former glory. But after <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> this Empire alſo was in diviſions, and the parts continued in the Title of the ten horns, in relation to the diviſion which was at firſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is ſaid of them, that they ſhould mingle themſelves with the ſeed of men; that is, endeavour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by Marriages to unite the diviſions; but yet the kingdoms ſhould not be united, but continue in diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Iron cannot be mixed with Clay, Verſ. 43. And of the truth of this attribute, we have had frequent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in theſe later times.</p>

                        <hi>The deſtruction of this Empire by the ſtone,</hi> Verſ. 34, 45.</head>
                     <p>THe ſtone doth ſignifie the Saints, Verſ. 44. with Chap. 7.22, 26. It is cut out of a great mountain, which is the Romane Empire, bearing rule before upon the earth, the Dominions of Antichriſt, Verſ. 35, 45. From hence the Saints are cut out, by profeſſed ſeparation and victorious exemption. They are thus cut out without hands, that is, by the onely power and finger of Almighty God, as it is interpreted, Verſ. 44, 45. Thus they began to be cut out, <hi>anno</hi> 1160, in the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and continue ſo unto this day: And the extraordinary hand of God was ſeen therein, as the ſtrange ariſing, growth, prevailing of them doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly declare. But their abſolute cutting out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the power of Antichriſt, is that which is to be expected at the term of the ſlaughter of the two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: when their riſing by the power alone of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, without the help of man, is thus deſcribed, <hi>Revel.</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:113414:6"/>11.11. <hi>And after three days and an half, the ſpirit of life from God entred into them, and they ſtood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that ſaw them: and they aſcended up to heaven in a cloud,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And ſo this ſtone, or kingdom of the Saints, ſhall be ſet up even in the days of thoſe Kings, Verſ. 44; that is, of Antichriſt and the ten horns ſignified by the feet and ten toes: which it ſtriking, ſhall daſh in pieces, and they ſhall be no more, Verſ. 35. Then this ſtone, or kingdom of the Saints, having been ſet up immediately after the three days and half, now upon the deſtruction of Antichriſt his Kingdom, ſhall become agreat mountain, and fill the whole earth, Verſ. 35, 44. A great mountain, that is, the ſupreme kingdom: filling all the earth, becauſe all domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſhall be ſubject unto it, Chap. 7.14, 27. Ezek. 17.22, 23.</p>

                  <p>AS for the three firſt Beaſts, there is little or no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie moved about them. I come unto the fourth, deſcribed Verſ. 7, 8, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Some, by the fourth Beaſt, underſtand the Succeſſors after <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Grecian kingdom, and eſpecially the kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae:</hi> and by the little horn, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes. Graſerus</hi> hath largely and learnedly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned this opinion; from whom I alleadge againſt it theſe Arguments.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> belongeth to the third Beaſt, and is one of the four parts into which the Greeian kingdom was divided after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113414:6"/>expreſly repreſented in his four wings and four heads, Verſ. 6: the truth of which interpretation will clearly appear, by comparing Chap. 8.8, 22. and 11.4. For the king of <hi>Grecia</hi> is expreſly diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Alexander,</hi> as the whole from the part, comprehending both him &amp; the quadrupartite diviſion among his Succeſſors, Chap. 8.21, 22. Therefore both he and the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> with other his Succeſſors, are included in the third Beaſt, and cannot be extended to the fourth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe theſe four Beaſts aroſe ſucceſſively to ſubdue the world, Verſ. 2, 3. But the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſucceſſors of <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſucceeded into it already ſubdued by him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Preface prefixed to the fourth Beaſt: — <hi>Afterward I ſaw in the Viſions by night, and behold.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of him without a name, as an unknown and ſtrange Monſter; the ſollicitous and curious enquiry of <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning him, Verſ. 19; the beſtowing of a far larger and more accurate deſcription upon him then upon the former Beaſts, do plainly argue, that the fourth kingdom here ſignified, is far more great and wonderful then any of the former, and therefore cannot be the kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the fourth Beaſt is ſaid to be dreadful, and terrible, and very ſtrong, in compariſon with the Beaſts going before; having Iron teeth and Brazen nails, devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and breaking in pieces, and ſtamping the reſidue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet. But the kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> was weaker then that of <hi>Alexander,</hi> as it is expreſly ſaid, Chap. 8.22, and did not devour and deſtroy ſo as the former king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as entring upon a world ſubdued already by <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great;</hi> therefore the fourth kingdom cannot be the kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae.</hi> Thou wilt ſay, The fourth kingdom is thus expreſſed, not in relation to the world
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113414:7"/>or ſtate general, but to the Jewiſh Church, unto which it was more terrible and ſtronger then the former. But it is manifeſt, that the Iron ſtrength is the character of this kingdom diſtinguiſhing it in a general and unlimited com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the kingdoms going before. To exert in ſome one particular place, ſuch as <hi>Judea,</hi> more cruelty, by reaſon of the weakneſſe of the people, and not by reaſon of his own abſolute ſtrength; is not a ſufficient reaſon that he ſhould be characterized and diſtinguiſhed from the others by the character of ſtrength and fear fulneſſe: No more verily then the Spaniſh Inquiſition, or <hi>Phalaris,</hi> or ſome other Tyrant, may be ſuperlatively compared in ſtrength with <hi>Cyrus, Alexander, Julius Caeſar,</hi> becauſe more cruel and formidable then they, in reſpect of ſome weak and not-reſiſting perſons, over whom, without exertion of much ſtrength, they might eaſily exerciſe their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Again, their ſtrength was not ſo much terrible to the Jews as <hi>Nebuchad-nezzar</hi> or <hi>Haman</hi> were. And the Jews againſt the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> would have vindicated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into liberty, and had defended themſelves ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, had not the Romanes come upon them, and broken them down at laſt, and the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> together. Laſtly, it is expreſly ſaid, that the fourth kingdom is thus ſtrong, irony and terrible, not onely in relation to the Jews, but alſo to the whole earth. For it is ſaid, that it ſhould devour the whole earth, and tread it down, and break it in pieces, Verſ. 23. And Chap. 2.40, it is expreſly ſaid to be of Iron, becauſe it ſhall bruiſe and break in pieces all the former kingdoms. And how ſhall this be verified of the <hi>Seleucidae?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, this Beaſt is ſaid to be unlike to the Beaſts that were before it; whereas the kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> was like other kingdoms. Some ſay it was unlike in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ten horns. But theſe (as they will have it) are ten ſucceeding Kings; which in kinde and nature is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113414:7"/>ordinary to all kingdoms. They ſay it is extraordinary in this reſpect, becauſe ſome of the Egyptian Kings are mixed in the number. But what ground of ſuch a mixture? Becauſe (ſay they) they are deſcribed, Chap. 11, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is no mention of ten horns, Chap. 11; the number there not adaequately ten: no reaſon to extrude ſome, to intrude others, but rather contrary to reaſon, as <hi>Graſerus</hi> ſheweth.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, the fourth Beaſt hath ten horns, and a little horn ariſing after them, by whom three of the former were rooted out, Verſ. 7, 8. How will this agree to the kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae?</hi> They ſay they are ten ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings, whereof <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> is the tenth and laſt, and the ſame the little horn. But if onely by ſucceſſion, then really in all particular differences of time, it had but one horn, and ſo the kingdom might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſaid to have one horn then ten. 2. Theſe ten horns here deſcribed, exiſted at the ſame time, not by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, becauſe the little horn aroſe among them, Verſ 8, and his look was more ſtout then his fellows, Verſe 20.3. How can <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> be both the little horn, and alſo the laſt of the ten, ſeeing the little horn is ſaid to ariſe beſides and after them? Verſ. 8, 20, 24. 4. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus</hi> cannot be the little horn, becauſe the little horn ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, groweth greater and greater, and more ſtately then the other horns, Verſe 8, 20, whereas <hi>Antiochus</hi> was not ſo great as his father <hi>Antiochus Magnus.</hi> 5. What are the three horns, and how did they fall before <hi>Antiochus?</hi> Verſ. 8. It is ſaid that they are <hi>Ptolaemcus Philopater</hi> King of <hi>Egypt, Seleucus</hi> the brother of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and <hi>Demetrius.</hi> But was <hi>Seleucaes</hi> rooted out, becauſe he died by ſlowe and lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring hatred? And how can <hi>Demetrius</hi> be one of the three, which was not reckoned by the authors of this opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ten? Verſ. 8. Laſtly, by the fall of the three,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113414:8"/>the little horn grew greater then the reſt, whereas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was added to <hi>Antiochus</hi> beſide the ancient kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae.</hi> 6. The little horn is to rage againſt the Saints <hi>a time, two times, and an half.</hi> How will this agree unto <hi>Antiochus?</hi> Becauſe (ſay they) the Temple was profaned by <hi>Antiochus</hi> three yeers and ten days But here it is <hi>half a time,</hi> or half a yeer, as alſo it appeareth by comparing Chap. 12.7. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.14. 7. The Beaſt falleth in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the little horn, Verſ. 11. But the kingdom of the <hi>Seleucida</hi> did not fall in <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, this fourth kingdom is extended until the laſt Judgement by fire, Verſ. 9, and the opening of the books, Verſ. 10. with 2 Theſſ. 2.8. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19.20. By com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of which places, it is clear that theſe expreſſions cannot be underſtood of the torments and death of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus,</hi> but of the laſt Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, it is extended until the coming of Chriſt in the clouds of heaven, Verſ. 13, 14, which is his ſecond coming, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.30. and 26.64. For it is not ſaid that he aſcended in the clouds, but that he came, Verſ. 13.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, it is extended to the time when all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the earth ſhall be the Lords and his Chriſts, Verſ. 14. with <hi>Apoc,</hi> 11.15; and when the kingdom ſhall be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the Saints of the moſt High, all hoſtile forces utterly ſuppreſſed, Verſ. 14, 26. Chap. 2.44. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.17, 18. And how can this be verified in the kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And upon theſe grounds I conclude with <hi>Graſerus,</hi> that the fourth kingdom here ſpoken of, is not the kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae.</hi> Now the third Beaſt being the Greek king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, what ſhould the fourth be but the kingdom follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is the Romane kingdom? which I alſo prove by theſe Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, becauſe after <hi>Alexander</hi> and the diviſion of his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113414:8"/>kingdom into four parts in his Succeſſors, propoſed in the deſcription of the former Beaſt, the Romane kingdom did immediately follow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe one badge of this Beaſt is the ten horns, which is attributed to the Romane kingdom, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.3. and 13.1, 2. and 17.9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Monarchy ſignified by the fourth Beaſt, continueth to the laſt Judgement, Verſe 9, 10, with <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.11, and to the deſtruction of the Beaſt and Dragon at the time of the end, Verſe 11, with <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.6. and 19.20. and 20.10, and to the coming of Chriſt the ſecond time in the clouds of heaven, Verſe 13, with <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.7. and to the riſing of <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> the kingdom of the Saints, Verſ. 14, 26, with <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe the ſame ſpace and form of duration is attributed to the little horn as to Antichriſt of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane kingdom, Verſe 25, with <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.14; therefore the little horn is Antichriſt, and the fourth Beaſt the Romane kingdom. I adde, that the characters of the little horn and of Antichriſt are the ſame, as may appear, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Verſe 25, 8, with <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.5, 6. Now Antichriſt ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the Romane kingdom, if the little horn ariſing be Antichriſt, then the Beaſt wherein he riſeth, is the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Becauſe in all other partieulars the deſcription of the fourth Beaſt agreeth to the Romane kingdom, as may appear in the partioular Expoſition.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. BY the ruine or deſtruction of this little horn, the fourth Beaſt, or Romane kingdom, is ſaid utterly and finally to fall, Verſ. 11: whereas by the fall of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> it would rather be eſtabliſhed: Therefore he is not <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but the Antichriſt of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The deſtroying of the Beaſt and little horn, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up to the burning fire, is deſcribed in ſuch forms as are in the <hi>Revelation</hi> interpreted of Antichriſt, Verſ. 9, 10, 11, with <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.20. and 20.10, 11. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14, with 2 Theſſ. 2.8.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This little horn is conjoyned with the ten horns, Verſ. 7, 8, 20, 24, accordingly as Antichriſt is conjoyned with them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13 and 17.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The characters attributed to him, are the ſame which are attributed unto Antichriſt. As, 1. That he ſhall ſpeak great things with a preſumptuous mouth againſt the moſt High, Verſ. 8, 25, with <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.5, 6. 2. That he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth himſelf above the Civil Magiſtrate, Verſ. 20, with 2 Theſſ. 2.4. 3. That he changeth Laws and Times, Verſ. 25. with 2 Theſſ. 2.3, 4. 4.

4. Others affirming the little horn to be Antichriſt, ſay that the three horns are the <hi>Greeks, Longobards,</hi> and <hi>Franks,</hi> which were ſubdued by the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceſſively. But I object, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Longobards</hi> were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſubdued by him; he had not yet attained to the power of decreeing and making War, but onely by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty he petitioned the help of Kings, by whom they were ſubdued. 2. The three horns are expreſly fixed, partly in <hi>Judea,</hi> and partly in the South and Eaſt, in the way and paſſage thereunto, Chap. 8.9, 10; and therefore cannot be the <hi>Greeks, Franks,</hi> and <hi>Longobards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5.

Firſt, becauſe about this time the Pope began to decree and make War himſelf, and not before. 2. This was one of the greateſt acts that Antichriſt ever did; and therefore fit to be a character of him. 3. Theſe Kings were preciſely three, and properly ſubdued by him. 4. They are properly in <hi>Judea,</hi> and the South, and Eaſt, in the paſſage thereunto, Chap. 8.9. 5.

                     <p>Firſt, the admirable condition of the fourth Beaſt, in compariſon to the former, is marked out by a Preface larger then ordinary: <hi>After this, I ſaw i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is propoſed as a ſtrange and unknown mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter without a name, in theſe words, <hi>A fourth Beast.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe of the diſſimilitude of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to all precedent kingdoms, and the ſtrange variety of the forms thereof, as it is expreſſed afterwards. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it hath a compoſition and concurrence in it ſelf of all the properties of the former Beaſts; being likened to the Babylonian Lion, to the Perſian Bear, and to the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Leopard, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.1, 2.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is ſuid to be dreadful and terrible; which noteth the ability and readineſſe of this Empire to annoy with great evils: for a ready power of hurting greatly, is the ground of dread and terrour.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it is ſtrong exceedingly: for the Romane Empire hath been ſtrong as Iron, in compariſon of all other kingdoms, breaking and bruiſing them all, Chap.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113414:12"/>2.40, and devouring the whole earth, Chap. 7.23.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, it hath great Iron teeth; which ſignifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Captains, ſuch as <hi>Scipio, Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſtrong, irreſiſtible as Iron, in compariſon of all before. And for the ſame cauſe, the Romane Empire is repreſented by Iron leggs, Chap. 2.40.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly,
<note place="margin">Graſ. de Antic.</note> it hath nails of Braſſe, Verſ. 19. A Beaſt maketh his aſſault for victory with his his teeth; and after victory, uſeth his claws to tear. Therefore as the teeth are the Captains making Conqueſts; ſo the nails are the Romane Senate and Provincial Magiſtrates; theſe being of Braſſe, as the other were of Iron, becauſe ſomewhat milder then the Captains.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, the actions of both teeth and nails are ſet down in the next words. Of the teeth thus: <hi>It devoured and brake in pieces.</hi> Of the feet and nails thus: <hi>It ſtamped the reſidue with the feet thereof.</hi> Thus the Romane Empire by its Captains devoured the weaker, brake in pieces the ſtronger; and by its Magiſtrates ſtamped the reſidue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet; handled and tare at pleaſure the conquered, crowing and inſulting after Conqueſts.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, the extent of Victory is added, Verſ. 23, that it ſhall devour the whole earth; that is, a great part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, even from the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> into <hi>Great Britanny.</hi> See Luke 2.1.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, It is added, that it was unlike to, diverſe from the Beaſts that were before it. This is ſaid both in reſpect of preſent ſtate, and alſo in reſpect of multiplicity of forms ſucceſſive therein. For, to uſe the words of <hi>Graſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> it endeavoured to fit and frame the Forms of all other kingdoms to it ſelf, but altered. And in reſpect of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity and ſtrange multiplicity of Forms of Government, it is repreſented <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.3. and 13.1. and 17, by ſeven heads, and an eighth, and ten horns. The Governments
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113414:12"/>were of Kings, Conſuls, Tribunes, Decemviti, Dictators, Romane Emperours, Popes, with the ten Kings.</p>

                     <p>OBſerve firſt, that the Popes Expeditions againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> overflowed them about the yeer 1098: and Sixty two yeers after, that is, in the yeer 1160, the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> aroſe in <hi>France,</hi> profeſſing the ſame Doctrine that we do now, and made an abſolute ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope uſed what means he could to root them out; but the more they were perſecuted, the more they multiplied: ſo that on a ſudden they filled that great Tract of Land which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>eth between the <hi>Alps</hi> and the <hi>Pirenaean</hi> mountains. Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the third, perceiving the inſufficiency of former Perſecutions, called a Synod in the yeer 1204, and there decreed that the Expeditions of the Croſſe, which had been appointed againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſhould now be turned
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113414:14"/>againſt the <hi>Waldenſes:</hi> and the Catholikes (ſaith he) that ſhall take up the Croſſe for rooting them out, let them enjoy the ſame pardon of their ſins which is granted unto them that go againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> for the recovering of the holy Land. For the ſtirring up of this flame, he ſent about his Preachers, who in likelihood carried themſelves as a little after, when taking this or ſuch like Texts; <hi>Who will riſe up with me againſt the evil doers, and who will ſtand with me againſt the workers of iniquity?</hi> they were wont to conclude their Sermons in this manner: <hi>Ye ſee now, dearly beloved, how great is the malice of the Hereticks: ye ſee alſo how much hurt they do in the world: ye ſee again how religiouſly and by how many godly ways the Church laboureth to reclaim them: But theſe means can do no good with them; nay, they defend themſelves by Secular power: And therefore the holy Mother the Church, though unwilling, and with grief, doth call together a Chriſtian Army againſt them. Whoſoever therefore hath the zeal of faith, whoſoever there is whom the honour of God doth touch, whoſoever there is that will have that great Pardon, let him come and take the Croſſe, let him joyn himſelf to the War of the Crucifix.</hi> By theſe and ſuch like means,

At which time, the Earl of <hi>Tolouze,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Beſiers,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Foix,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Comming,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Bearne,</hi> ſtood out in defence of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> againſt the fury of the Pope. The Popes Agents and Souldiers took their Cities, Towns, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſpoiled and pillaged their Countreys; killed by the Sword, captivated, burned, hanged, and diſmembred, with moſt mercileſſe and cruel behaviour: until about the yeer 1213, and ſo forward, when the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> began to riſe again with a little help; fire going forth of their mouthes, and devouring them that hurt them. Neither could
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113414:14"/>the Pope any more by War effectually prevail, until turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to policie and deceit, by flatteries and lying promiſes he did utterly overflow and break them down. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeer 1228, the old Earles of <hi>Tolouze</hi> and <hi>Foix</hi> being dead,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 117</note> the young Earl of <hi>Tolouze</hi> was allured by the Abbot of <hi>Grandſelve,</hi> to come to <hi>Meaux</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> there to conclude a Peace: fair promiſes pretended, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance given of ſafe return. There, contrary to faith and promiſe, the Popes Agents did catch the Earl under hatches, enſlaved him to the Pope. By the like flattery they took the Earl of <hi>Foix.</hi> In depth of policie they ſet upon him by the forced mediation of the deceived Earl of <hi>Tolouze,</hi> by whom they thought they could moſt apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually work and accompliſh their deſignes. He accordingly wrote to ſome of the ſubjects of the Earl of <hi>Foix,</hi> who being frighted with the apprehenſion of their ruine, ſhould intreat their Earl both to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on himſelf and ſubjects, who would doubtleſſe be overthrown by this violence: that they ſhew him that there was an excellent opportunity offered, the onely means to make them live in perfect peace, if they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to ſubmiſſion. By the requeſts and tears of theſe frighted perſons, and the deceitful plots and tricks of the Popes Agents, this Earl was taken alſo; and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up, as a gage of his affection, the Caſtles of <hi>Foix,
<note place="margin">Pag. 130.</note> Montgailard, Montreal, Vicdeſos,</hi> and <hi>Lordat,</hi> for the good of the Peace in general, while he yeelded the homage demanded. Thus a Peace and Compoſition was made by theſe two Earls, through ſubmiſſion to the Pope; which two props being gone,
<note place="margin">Pag. 130.</note> the Earl of <hi>Comming</hi> and Prince of <hi>Bearne</hi> could not continue. See then, to appearance, the end of the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> when in the yeer 1234, <hi>Trancavel</hi> a Baſtard-ſon of the Earl of <hi>Beſiers,</hi> ſtood up in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence with moſt proſperous ſucceſſe. To take him off,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113414:15"/>the Popes Agents uſed another politick device: for they cunningly wrought on him by the mediation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Earl of <hi>Foix,</hi> through great promiſes and threats of danger, to bring him to ſome peaceable deſigne; and their craft ſucceſſefully proſpered in his hand.

                     <p n="1">1. THat his riſing is among the ten horns, in theſe words: <hi>There came up among them.</hi> So that the firſt riſing of Antichriſt doth concur with the firſt riſing of the ten horns. And ſo expreſly, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.12, they receive power as Kings at one hour with the Beaſt. And Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt was to be manifeſted upon the removal of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, 2 Theſſ. 2.7, 8, which began effectually to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113414:15"/>be removed by the ten Kings after <hi>Conſtantine the Great:</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionately with the fall of the Romane Empire, and the riſing of the ten Kings, the riſing of Antichriſt muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur; who therefore began gradually to proceed, together with the irruptions of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> into his kingdom, and diſſipation of the Empire; and in 606 was openly enthroned. But, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.24, Antichriſt is ſaid to come up after the ten horns. This underſtand of his open enthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which began in 606, after the Inundation of the ten Kings: but ſecretly and hiddenly he aroſe before, even among them, and together with them, as here it is expreſſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He is called <hi>Another horn,</hi> that is, another beſide the ten, and as it is expreſſed verſ. 24, diverſe from them: they being Political, he alſo Eccleſiaſtical, by uſurpation of an independent authority Spiritual.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He is called <hi>A little horn,</hi> becauſe little at firſt, as onely Primate and Metropolitane of the Churches of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and by little and little encroaching upon the power of the ten Kings, by ſmall and ſcarce diſcernable degrees of proceeding. Before the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was onely a poor and mean Miniſter, therefore called <hi>Vile,</hi> or <hi>of lowe condition,</hi> Chap. 11.21; from which weak lowe eſtate, he cunningly and ſecretly came up among the ten horns, until he overtopped them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. His firſt ariſing is intimated to be hidden, obſcure and ſecret, ſcarce diſcernable; and therefore he is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented among the horns, that <hi>Daniel</hi> doth not eſpie or diſcover him, but by a prying eye, and a minde curiouſly conſidering. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>I conſidered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is added, that <hi>before him three of the firſt horns were plucked up by the roots.</hi> The firſt War of Antichriſt which was waged by him, after he came to the fulneſſe of his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113414:16"/>kingdom. As the Romane Empire fell, ſo gradually he aroſe. He was openly enthroned in 606. A temporal Dominion was given him by <hi>Pipin,</hi> in 755: But his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority aroſe not ſo high, as generally to overtop and command at pleaſure the Kings and Emperours, until the time of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> after 1073. Thenceforth he began to decree and make Wars himſelf, and by Imperial au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to command the Kings and Emperours of the Weſt, to go forth as ſubjects in the Wars decreed by him. And from the foreſaid 1073, he had ſeditiouſly ſtirred Wars in <hi>Germany:</hi> but the great and notable War directly decreed by him, with voluntary and general ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Kings, Princes, and Emperours, was that which was decreed at <hi>Claremont</hi> about Two and twenty yeers after, in 1095, againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> which here followeth to be deſcribed. And in this War it was verified which was here ſaid of Antichriſt, that three of the firſt horns were rooted up before him. For within about three yeers after the foreſaid Decree at <hi>Claremont,</hi> by the yeer 1099, he by his Souldiers of the Croſſe root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, ſubdued, cauſed to fall (as the phraſes run, verſ. 8.20, 24) three Kings of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens: Solyman</hi> in <hi>Aſia, Caſsianus</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> the <hi>Egyptian Caliph</hi> in <hi>Judea.</hi> That theſe three Kings are meant, I am more then probably convinced, from Chap. 8.9. and 11.29, places exactly parallel, where they are expreſly reſtrained to <hi>Judea</hi> the pleaſant Land, and to the Eaſt and South in the way unto it, which muſt be <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> from the Northern horn of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewed when I come unto the next Chapter. In mean time, obſerve theſe phraſes arguing the places to be parallel.</p>

                     <p>And as it is here ſaid, that <hi>three kings were rooted up from before him;</hi> ſo Chap. 11.22, <hi>The arms of a ſtood ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown from before him:</hi> which is to be underſtood of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> as I truſt to ſhew, when I come unto the place. But here a Doubt ariſeth, How theſe three <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan</hi> Kings are called three of the firſt horns, ſeeing the ten were numbred without the comprehenſion of them. <hi>Anſw.</hi> They may not be called formally three of the firſt horns; that is, as under the form and ſpecial kinde of them; but onely materially, as being the ſame onely in outward figure, and now applied to a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation. And this is proved by Verſe 24, where although in reſpect of the outward figure and type, he is ſaid to root out three of the firſt horns; yet when the thing ſignified cometh to be ſpoken of, it is onely thus ſaid, that <hi>ten horus are ten kings that ſhall ariſe; and another ſhall ariſe after them, and he ſhall ſubdue three Kings.</hi> Mark, it is not ſaid, that <hi>he ſhall ſubdue three of them,</hi> or, <hi>three of the former Kings,</hi> as in the Type; but onely <hi>three kings,</hi> as if diſtinguiſhed from the former ten.</p>

                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:113414:17"/>
But ſecondly, and more ſatisfactorily, it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that in a more general ſenſe the ten horns may comprehend any that divided the Empire, ſuch as <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> then, as hath been ſaid before. But whereas it may be objected, from <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.17, that the ten horns give their kingdoms to the Beaſt, it is to be underſtood not of the ten horns in general, but of thoſe onely who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the Beaſt. The <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> and <hi>Burgundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are among the ten horns, and yet they ſurvived not to give their kingdoms to the Beaſt: proportionably we may judge of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. And thus far of the firſt War of Antichriſt againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens.</hi> His ſecond War followeth, againſt the Saints, which is deſcribed Verſe 22. <hi>I beheld, and is, this horn made war with the Saints, and prevailed againſt them.</hi> Verſ. 25, <hi>He ſhall wear out the Saints of the moſt High.</hi> Which ſecond War began againſt the Waldeſian Proteſtants ſince the yeer 1160, and yet continueth, and muſt, until the end of the Reign of Antichriſt, when <hi>the ancient of days ſhall ſit in Judgement,</hi> and <hi>the kingdom of New Jeruſalem ſhall be ſet up,</hi> Verſ. 9.10, 26.</p>

He is ſaid to have <hi>eyes like the eyes of a man,</hi> Verſe 8. either in reſpect of his feigned courteſie and flattering humanity, Chap. 8.25, or in reſpect of his intolerable pride and arrogancy, Verſe 20, with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.3, 4, &amp; 18.27; or rather in reſpect of wiſedom and policie, Chap. 8.25, with <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.17, and the eye of his Philoſophical and Scholaſtical underſtanding, whereby he is ſaid to ſee and underſtand dark myſteries, Chap. 8.23.</p>

                     <p n="9">9. It is ſaid particularly, that <hi>he ſhall think that he may change Laws and Times.</hi> He ſhall not onely change them, but alſo think it lawful for him ſo to do, as ſupreme Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of Chriſt on earth. So he ſhall change Laws, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving <hi>the daily Sacrifice,</hi> or true Worſhip, in reading, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and teaching of the Truth, in Prayer and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and by ſetting up his abominations and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Idolatries, Chap. 11.30, 31, and Doctrines of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, Chap. 11.37, 38, 39. Times he changeth, by ordaining ſuperſtitious holy days.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. His look is ſaid to be <hi>more ſtout then his fellows,</hi> that is, then the ten horns, Verſ. 20, whereby is ſignified his exaltation of himſelf above Kings and Princes; whereof ſee Chap. 11.36, 37.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The duration of Antichriſt is determined by a <hi>time, two times, and a half,</hi> Verſ. 25; that is, One thouſand two hundred and ſixty yeers, as it is expounded <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.6, 14. The riſing of Antichriſt is to be fixed at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fall of the Romane Empire, and riſing of the ten horns. But of this more fully in another place.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And thus much of the deſcription of Antichriſt his nature, actions, characters, and duration. Now his Fall and Ruine is deſcribed in this manner.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Daniel</hi> is ſaid to behold till the horns were ſet up. <hi>Set up,</hi> not <hi>caſt down,</hi> according to the Original. This is to note that Antichriſt continueth his reign and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion until the ſetting up of the Thrones of Judgement. So it is more plainly ſaid, Verſe 21, 22, 25, 26.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The ancient of days did ſit.</hi> This is God the Judge, called <hi>the ancient of days,</hi> becauſe he ever lived to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and now infallibly to bring to remembrance
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113414:18"/>all the ancient and long-paſt villanies of the Man of ſin.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. His <hi>garments were white as ſnow,</hi> to note the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of his Judgements, Will and Actions. So his Throne is white for the ſame end, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.11, 12.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>hair of his head is like the pure wool,</hi> to note the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of his Counſels and Decrees.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>His throne is like a fiery flame, and his wheels like burning fire,</hi> to note his ſpeed and wrath in coming unto Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>A fiery ſtream iſſued and came forth from before him,</hi> to note the iſſue and execution of his Judgement, beginning in temporal conſumptions, ending in eternal burnings.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>A thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him;</hi> to note the aſſiſtance of his Saints and Angels numberleſſe, in the ſentence and execution of the laſt Judgement, 1 Cor. 6.2, 3.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>The Judgement was ſet, and the Books opened.</hi> It is ſet for the deſtroying of the fourth Beaſt, the Romane Empire, and Antichriſt, after the <hi>time, two times, and a half;</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in temporal deſtruction, finiſhed in eternal, and compleated univerſally in the Reſurrection, at the end of Fourty and ſive yeers, Chap. 12.11, 12. The Judgement muſt be ſet, to deſtroy great <hi>Babylon</hi> unto the end, Verſ. 26; that is, unto end of the ſaid yeers, and to the full end and deſtruction of all the reliques and remainders of <hi>Babylon</hi> Spiritual. And the Books are opened, to ſignifie an open diſcovery of all the works of Antichriſt and his followers, that they may be proportionably rewarded.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Daniel</hi> is ſaid to behold them <hi>upon the ſetting up of the thrones of Judgement,</hi> and again, to behold <hi>till the Beast was ſlain:</hi> to note, that although the deadly blowe is given unto Antichriſt at the firſt erecting of the Thrones of Judgement; yet the deſtruction of his kingdom is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113414:18"/>to be brought unto perfection, as in Fourty five yeers before expreſſed.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The deſtruction of Antichriſt is declared in three degrees. 1. The Beaſt is ſlain. The Beaſt is the Romane Empire, ſubſiſting under Antichriſt and his horns: and it is ſlain, to note the deadly blowe given thereunto at the beginning of the Judgement, in the battel of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> whereof read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.8. 2. His body is deſtroyed. This is the ſecond degree, noting the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual deſtruction of great <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Body and Kingdom of the Beaſt, partly by inteſtine ſlaughter, partly by the parts falling off and oppreſſing her under the Standard of the Witneſſes of Truth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.1, 2, 3. <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. The third and laſt degree is thus expreſſed: <hi>And his body was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the burning fire,</hi> which noteth the full end and abſolute conſumption of all the relikes of the kingdom by the end of the Fourty five yeers. Compare Verſe 26 with <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.20. and 20.14.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. As concerning the reſt of the Beaſts, it is ſaid, that <hi>they</hi> alſo <hi>had their dominion taken away,</hi> and that <hi>their lives were prolonged</hi> onely <hi>for a ſeaſon and a time,</hi> Verſ. 12. The meaning ſeemeth to be, that not onely the Romane kingdom, but all the reſt before expreſſed, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thus deſcribed, paſſed away: foraſmuch as they all were temporary, and appointed of God to continue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a time and ſeaſon, the kingdom of the Saints onely eternal; concerning which in the next words.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Daniel</hi> beholdeth this in night-Viſions, becauſe while the dark night of Calamity covereth the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, the light ariſeth on <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> Iſai. 60.1, 2. and 21.12. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113414:19"/>26, He is ſaid to <hi>come;</hi> and this is his ſecond coming, in a large ſenſe, comprehending his coming to bear rule on earth, by ſetting up his Kingdom, breaking down the enemy, and this the ſpace of Fourty five yeers: and then his viſible appearing at the Reſurrection immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, to finiſh his <hi>new Jeruſalem</hi> begun, in heavenly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And in this large deſcription his ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is uſually taken in the Prophets. He is ſaid to come <hi>in the clouds of heaven;</hi> that is, on high, above the glory and power of the kingdoms of the earth, in the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent majeſtie of his Kingdom, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.30.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He is ſaid to come to <hi>the Ancient of days;</hi> that is, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, to obtain the kingdom for his Saints, removed from the enemy. So the Lamb is ſaid to approach to him <hi>that ſate upon the Throne, to receive the Book:</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he that ſitteth on the Throne, is alſo Chriſt as God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.7.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is added, that <hi>they brought him neer before him.</hi> Until better light may ſhine, I cannot but conjecture that they do ſignifie the Saints. Theſe bring Chriſt neer to the <hi>Ancient of days</hi> by the importunity of prayers, for the obtaining of the Kingdom, and removal of it from the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Hereupon, <hi>dominion is given unto him, and glory. To him,</hi> that is, to Chriſt and to his Saints, Verſ. 26, 27. This kingdom beginneth with the beginning of the fall of Antichriſt, and with the ſetting up of the Thrones of Judgement, as appeareth Verſ. 21, 22, 26, 27, and is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in heavenly perfection, at the Reſurrection imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately enſuing.</p>
                     <p n="6">6, The greatneſſe of his kingdom is ſignified in theſe words, that <hi>all people, nations and languages ſhould ſerve him.</hi> Hereby is ſignified the Univerſal Converſion of the

                  <head>The Controverſal Part.</head>
                  <p>ABout the precedent Beaſts and horns deſcribed in the Viſion, there is no Controverſie; and therefore I deſcend unto the little horn, which hath been hitherto (for ought I know) according to the letter expounded of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> But that it is not ſo to be expounded, I prove by theſe Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The little horn that magnified himſelf unto the South, and Eaſt, and pleaſant Land, is by parallel compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon the ſame little horn that rooted out the three, Chap. 7.8. Now that little horn (as it is moſt evident)
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113414:20"/>is Antichriſt or the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> belonging to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane kingdom; and therefore cannot be <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This little horn ariſeth when the tranſgreſſors ſhall come to the full, and in the end of the Grecian Empire, Chap. 8.23; whereas <hi>Antiochus</hi> was in the midſt, and far from the time of the great and full degree of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The horn here ſpoken of, is in reſpect of his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings called <hi>a little horn:</hi> whereas <hi>Antiochus</hi> was not ſo lowe at firſt, as to be called a little horn. For (to uſe the words of judicious <hi>Graſerus de Antich. p.</hi> 76.) <hi>Antiochus,</hi> in reſpect of his Parentage, and Condition of Fortune which he had thereby, was ſo great, even from his Infancy, that then in the world known unto us, there was ſcarce another to be compared with him; being the undoubted ſon of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus the great,</hi> and after <hi>Seleucus Philopater</hi> his elder brother, right Heir of the kingdoms of <hi>Aſia, Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe this horn is ſaid to wax very great, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the former horns, Verſe. 9: whereas <hi>Antiochus</hi> (although he was great from his beginning) yet did not attain unto a condition greater then his fathers. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which let the words of <hi>Graſerus</hi> be obſerved, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the place before alleadged. He never had full poſſeſſion of the whole kingdom of his father <hi>Antiochus the great,</hi> which he poſſeſſed before the Romane War: the ſinews of War alſo failed him not once. And as for that which <hi>Junius</hi> alleadgeth concerning his taking of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> if that were true, yet it would little help his cauſe, ſeeing it is manifeſt that his father <hi>Antiochus</hi> did not leſſe exploits againſt <hi>Egypt.</hi> Indeed <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> did the ſecond time invade <hi>Egypt;</hi> but with ſuch a ſucceſſe; that he got more diſhonour then honour thereby. Neither in other Wars was he ſo happie and fortunate, that therein he might be ſo far preferred above his Anceſtors. In ſum,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113414:20"/>
                     <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> had little or nothing more then the meaner ſort of the Kings of <hi>Syria.</hi> Thus far <hi>Graſerus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. How did <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> ſo excellently magnifie himſelf unto the South, and to the Eaſt, and to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Land? How unto the Eaſt; foraſmuch as he was ignominiouſly put to flight and expelled out of <hi>Perſia</hi> in the Eaſt, by the Citizens of <hi>Elemais?</hi> How againſt the South; ſeeing in both his Expeditions againſt <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Noutler. Cron.</note> he was at laſt ſhamefully repulfed: the firſt time, by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains of <hi>Ptolomaeus;</hi> the ſecond time, by the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour <hi>Popilius?</hi> And how unto the pleaſant Land; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as after his Inteſtine cruelty on the Jews, his Princes and Armies were in <hi>Judea</hi> overthrown and put to flight by the Jews and their Captain <hi>Judas Maccabaus?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The acts of this little horn are extended to the time of the end, Verſ. 17, and of the laſt wrath, Verſ. 19; whereas <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> died long before the Birth of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In the judgement of a learned Author, the Two thouſand three hundred days mentioned Verſ. 14, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appliable to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> And <hi>Pererius</hi> ſheweth out of the firſt Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> that <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Perſecutions began in the yeer of the Grecian kingdom 143, and ended in the yeer 148,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 1.21.22. <hi>and</hi> 4.41, 52. <hi>Perer. in Dan. pag.</hi> 509, 510.</note> which could not be longer then ſix full yeers; and therefore it cannot fill up exactly the meaſure of Two thouſand three hundred days, which ſpace containeth ſix yeers, three months, and twenty days. For the three moneths and twenty days would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verabound. <hi>Pererius,</hi> to ſalve this difficulty, ſaith, that the yeers Two thouſand three hundred may be extended to the death of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> which was in the next yeer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. But according to the words of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the drift of the interpretation of the authors of this opinion, the foreſaid yeers Two thouſand three hundred muſt not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:113414:21"/>end in the death of <hi>Antiochus</hi> (although if they ſhould, yet the difficulty of exact accommodation would ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main) but in the ceſſation of perſecution and calamity of the Church, and in the purgation of the Sanctuary, Verſ. 13, 14; which being referred to the Jews in the time of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> came to paſſe exactly in the yeer of the Greek Empire One hundred fourty eight, as hath been ſaid, and cannot be extended to the yeer following.</p>
                  <p>Having ſhewed that this little horn is not <hi>Antiochus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanes,</hi> now I will adde a few Arguments to prove that it is Antichriſt or the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe it is deſcribed in a parallel deſcription with the little horn, Chap. 7.8, which muſt of neceſſity be Antichriſt, as hath been proved.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe it is a general and conſtant Apoſtacie, and in the time of the end, which is ſaid under this little horn to come to paſſe, Verſ. 12.17, 19, 26. Adde to this, that it is deſcribed with phraſes attributed to Antichriſt elſewhere, as Verſ. 24, with Ch. 11, 36. and 8.11.12; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the Antichriſtian Apoſtacie, and the little horn under whom it is, Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the deſcription of the little horn is parallel with the deſcription of the vile perſon, Chap. 11.21, whom we have ſhewed to be Antichriſt. Compare Chap. 8.9, with Chap. 11.21, 22. and 8.17, 19, with 11.35. and 8.9, 10, 24, 25, with 11.23, 24, 25, 33, 34. and 8.11, 12, with 11.31. 32.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, becauſe the Apoſtacie under this little horn, is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Verſ. 12, <hi>tranſgreſsion;</hi> and in the next verſe, where it is asked how long the ſaid tranſgreſſion ſhould laſt, it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>The tranſgreſsion making deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;</hi> which is the ſame with <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Chap. 11.31, and 12.11, <hi>The abomination making deſolate,</hi> which is manifeſtly to be underſtood of the Antichriſtian
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:113414:21"/>abomination; and therefore the little horn is Antichriſt, under whom it is.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the little horn is here interpreted in ſuch a deſcription as is not agreeable to any other, but unto Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; as that he is joyned with fulneſſe of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion or Apoſtaſie, verſe 23, and that he worketh rather by policie and craft, then by ſtrength; and by peace mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly deſtroying the holy people, Verſe 24, 25. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the other parts of the deſcription will moſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately and moſt congruouſly agree unto Antichriſt, as may be ſeen in the Expoſition.</p>

The <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy is preſented before him as a Ram heavie with Wool and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113414:22"/>fleſhineſſe, made ſlowe and unweildy with multitude of Riches, Countreys, Souldiers. And the Ram is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, ſtanding againſt him, not running, as <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> to note his ſlowneſſe, want of courage; intentin ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to defend then offend. He is alſo repreſented ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the River, which may either ſignifie the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> about which the <hi>Perſian</hi> Ram reſided, encamped, and prepared for defence: or elſe the River, that is, the multitudes and Nations in the Perſian Monarchy, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.2, 15, by which the Perſian Monarch ſtood, lingring, as truſting to his multitudes for defence, and ſtanding or incumbred therewithal. Againſt this Perſian Ram, the Grecian Goat maketh aſſault: Firſt, he is ſaid to come againſt him, in relation (as I ſuppoſe) to the ſlower preparations of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia:</hi> then to run unto him, in the ſwift and ſpeedy Marches of his ſon <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander the Great;</hi> and in the heat of his ſtrength (as the Oraginal expreſſeth) becauſe <hi>Alexander</hi> marched towards him as with great ſpeed, ſo with great ſtrength, not cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any doubtings or fearfulneſſe, but enlivened and made vigorous by the furious heat of courage and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted reſolution. This Verſe 6. Thirdly, he is ſaid to come neer the Ram: for after coming by ſlowe prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and running by quick and furious Marches, <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> did at laſt draw neer to the huge Armies of the Perſian Ram. Fourthly, being come neer, he is ſaid to be moved againſt him, that is, forthwith, without ling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and delaying, to have his courage and choler ſtirred up to Battel. <hi>Darius</hi> was a delaying Captain, and fearful; but <hi>Alexanders</hi> heat and reſolution could not endure dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Fifthly, he is ſaid to ſmite the Ram, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Perſian Armies in Battel. Sixthly, the next degree of proceeding conſiſteth in breaking his two horns. For the Armies being overthrown in Battel, forthwith the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:113414:23"/>Perſian horns and kingdoms came under his dominion. Seventhly, it is added, that there was no power in the Ram to ſtand againſt him: to note, that the Perſian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch after overthrow, repaired frequently his Armies, reſtored Battel, but ever fell more and more. Eighthly, it is added, that he caſt him down to the ground; to note an utter extinction of the Perſian kingdom, after various and ſundry overthrows. Ninthly, he ſtamped upon him, that is, after full Conqueſt, crowed, inſulted, triumphed. Laſtly, it is ſaid, that there was none that could deliver the Ram out of his power; to note an overthrow not onely of the Perſian kingdom, but of all helps and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours adjacent; yea, and <hi>Alexander</hi> alſo afterward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the conqueſt of the Countreys all about. Theſe are the ten degrees of the proceeding of the Grecian kingdom in the conqueſt of the Perſian, each one follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other in nature and deſcription; and the truth of all this, is abundantly witneſſed by Hiſtories. It is added, Verſ. 8, that therefore the Goat waxed exceeding great, as having ſubdued ſo many Countreys, and joyned them to the kingdom of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> But when he was at the greateſt, his great horn was broken, Verſ. 8. For <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander,</hi> in the midſt of his ſtrength, youth, power and greatneſſe of dominion, ſuddenly, beyond the opinion of men, periſhed, Chap. 11.4; and in place thereof, four horns came up to the four windes of heaven. For <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus Aridaeus</hi> took poſſeſſion of <hi>Macedonia</hi> in the Weſt: <hi>Amigonus</hi> of <hi>Aſia</hi> in the North: the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Eaſt: the <hi>Lagida</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the South.</p>

But the accommodation of this opinion and of the yeers unto the thing, is exceeding various and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by manifold opinions, and all of them clogged (as I ſuppoſe) with inextricable difficulties. For ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin theſe yeers at the fourth yeer of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> as <hi>Nicolaus de lyra,</hi> and others. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> begins them at the firſt yeer of <hi>Cyrus. Origen,</hi> from the firſt yeer of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the <hi>Mede. Julius Affricanus,</hi> from the twentieth yeer of <hi>Longimanus. Tertullian</hi> as <hi>Origen,</hi> but in a ſtrange Chronologie. <hi>Origen</hi> again elſewhere numbreth a day for Ten yeers, and ſo fetcheth them from <hi>Adam.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the ſixth yeer of <hi>Darius Hiſtaſpes.</hi> Others, from the ſecond of <hi>Darius Nothus.</hi> Others, from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus.</hi> See <hi>Pererius</hi> on <hi>Daniel, Reinold. Junius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others, finding no ſoundneſſe in theſe Opinions, flee
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:113414:27"/>to extremes. Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> and his followers denying the truth of Heathen Chronologie, conſtitute the yeers without ground. Doctor <hi>Reinolds</hi> on the other ſide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and maintaining the Heathen Chronologie; and finding no way how to accommodate theſe yeers unto it, affirmeth that no certain time is meant, but an uncertain and undetermined duration, in alluſion to the Seventy yeers of the Babylonian Captivity.</p>
                  <p>To ſpend long time in examining and confuting all theſe Opinions, and ſundry others that might be brought, would be exceeding tedious both to the Writer and the Reader, and unneceſſary alſo; foraſmuch as Doctor <hi>Reinolds, Pererius,</hi> and other Authors, have worthily ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the unſoundneſſe of other Opinions beſides their own, and their own impugned by one another. <hi>Graſerus,</hi> whom <hi>Piſcator</hi> ſeemeth to follow, being overwhelmed with the difficulty, or rather impoſſibility of accommodation, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that theſe yeers muſt begin at the Edict of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> but how to apply them according to Chronologie, they ingenuouſly confeſſe they cannot tell. All this I have alleadged, eſpecially for this end, that by ſo monſtrous variety of Opinions, and ſuch inextricable difficulties in every one of them, we may the more eaſily be brought to ſuſpect at leaſt, that the truth is not yet found, and that not contenting our ſelves with that which hath been already ſaid, we might be incited and encouraged to ſeek for further light.</p>
                  <p>I purpoſe, after all theſe, the unworthieſt of them, to adde my mite for the underſtanding of this Prophecie; not reſolutely and peremptorily determining what I ſhall ſay, but with ſubmiſſion to better Judgements, ſhewing what may be farther ſaid, and upon what grounds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, to prepare an eaſier way for the finding of the truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:113414:28"/>
THis Prophecie ſeemeth not to be underſtood of the times between the Babylonian Captivity and the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Lord, or deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe in no place of the New Teſtament this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie is uſed againſt the Jews, to prove the Meſſiah al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the reſtauration of the City, Verſ. 25, is of the material <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after <hi>Nebuchad-nezzars</hi> Captivity, it muſt begin in the firſt of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> from which time, Seventy weeks of yeers will fully expire long before the birth of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The firſt Diviſion of the Seventy weeks, is Seven weeks of yeers, Verſ. 25, the end whereof is expreſſely characterized by the ſetting up of a Meſſiah Governour, which cannot be verified in the ſetting up of the firſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Jews after the Captivity, much leſſe of Chriſt. For <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> was ſet up in the beginning, and Chriſt long after the end of all. No other Governour can be meant after the firſt, becauſe the ſetting up of one, pointeth at the firſt. Therefore if the Seven weeks end not in the ſetting up of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> or Chriſt, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, then they cannot be verified in the material ſtate of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after the Captivity of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The cutting off of the Meſſiah here ſpoken of, is expreſly joyned with the deſtruction of the City, in one week to be accompliſhed, the laſt Seven yeers, Verſ. 26, 27: whereas Chriſt ſuffered above Thirty yeers before the deſtruction of material <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thoſe phraſes, Verſ. 24, <hi>To finiſh the tranſgreſsion, To make an end of ſins, To purge iniquity, and To bring in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſſe,</hi> are manifeſt characters of the time of the end, as ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:113414:28"/>
My Judgement is, that theſe Seventy weeks of yeers are cut out for the reſtauration of the Spiritual <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Church of Chriſt, from the <hi>Babylon</hi> and ſervitude of Antichriſt; and muſt end in the full purgation thereof from Antichriſtian defilements, and from the courſe of other moral tranſgreſſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the effects characterizing the end of theſe yeers, <hi>the conſuming of tranſgreſsion,</hi> and <hi>the bringing in of everlasting righteouſneſſe,</hi> Verſ. 24, are effects to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in the Chriſtian Church, at the fall of Antichriſt, <hi>Iſal.</hi> 1.25, 26, 27, 28. and 27.9. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the other Prophets, the reſtauration of the Chriſtian Church from the <hi>Babylon</hi> of Antichriſt, is in like Types proportionably repreſented: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 10, and 11, and 13, and 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50 and 51. <hi>Apoe.</hi> 14.6, 7, 8. and 16.19. and 15.7. and 18.2, 10, 21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In all the other Prophecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the main ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of them is the hiſtory of Antichriſt, the <hi>Waldenſian</hi> Saints and their ſucceſſors, reſtored and reduced out of Antichriſtian Captivity. See Chap. 7, and 2, and 8, and 10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The parallel proportion of phraſe, argueth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed Prince, Verſ. 25, to be the Prince of the Covenant, Chap. 11.22, which there doth ſignifie the Princes of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſtreights of times, Verſ. 25, and the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the City, Verſ. 26, doth fitly agree to the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian perſecution. See Chap. 8.24, 11, 13.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The effects of the laſt weeks are parallel with the Antichriſtian perſecution deſcribed <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. For as the Chriſtian Church is in both places ſignified by the holy City, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.2. with <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26, and ſtreights of time ſaid in both places to go before the laſt afflictions, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.5, 3, 7. with <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25: ſo the laſt afflictions are alſo
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:113414:29"/>propoſed with marvellous agreement. There, three yeers and half of tyranny over the conquered Saints, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.8, 9, in the end of perſecution; here, half a week of yeers, that is, preciſely three and an half, out out for the ſame end. There, War immediately preceding the foreſaid triumph, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.7: here, in like manner.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. From the beginning of the ſecond half of the laſt week, or of the three yeers and half, a Prince is ſaid to cauſe the Sacrifice and Oblation to ceaſe, Verſ. 27. A phraſe attributed to Antichriſt, Chap. 8.11. and 11.31, there ſaid to take away <hi>the daily Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. In the ſame time the ſaid Prince is ſaid, Verſ. 27, for the overſpreading of abominations, to <hi>make deſolate.</hi> A phraſe attributed to Antichriſt, Chap. 8.12, 13. and 11.31, there ſaid to <hi>ſet up the abominations making deſolate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. It is added, Verſ. 27, <hi>Until the conſummation determined ſhall be poured on the deſolate.</hi> A phraſe alſo applied to the reſtraining of the Antichriſtian perſecution, Chap. 11.36.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. As the Seventy weeks, the diviſion of the Seven from the Sixty two, and of both from the one week, are unappliable to the material reſtauration out of real <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon:</hi> ſo they will exactly and preciſely agree to the reſtauration out of the Antichriſtian <hi>Babylon,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Upon theſe grounds of probability, I will adventure to propoſe the Interpretation following, with ſubmiſſion to the judgement of Brethren, and evidence of clearer light.</p>

And it is the end declared in the very Text: and otherwiſe it cannot eaſily be ſeen why this firſt diviſion of yeers ſhould be cut off or parted from the following diviſions. Now a Meſſiah Eccleſiaſtical was ſet up in the beginning of the yeers. For the Word went forth in the <hi>Waldenſian</hi> Paſtors, for the Spiritual Reſtauration of myſtical <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Church of Chriſt, out of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity and deſolation under <hi>Babylon</hi> Antichriſtian, in the yeer 1160. But a Political Meſſiah did not openly and profeſſedly ariſe, for the defence and protection of the <hi>Waldenſian</hi> Churches againſt the violence of Antichriſt, till Seven weeks or Fourty nine yeers after. And ſo the hiſtory doth expreſly ſhew; to wit, that the <hi>Waldenſian</hi> Princes did profeſſedly ſtand up in War againſt the Pope, in defence of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> or <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> in the yeer 1209: and from the former term 1160 to 1209, which is the later, are preciſely Seven weeks or Fourty nine yeers, not one yeer ſuperabundant or deficient.

Now the Princes of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> in this War undertaken and for about Twenty yeers continued, though they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times were worſted by the Antichriſtians, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the beginning; yet they defended the Reformed Churches, and by degrees prevailed; until ſuch time as the enemies, ſeeing little hope by force to bring them under, turned to flatteries and lyes, and ſo deceived them. <hi>Dun.</hi> 8.25. and 11.23, 24.</p>
                     <p>But here cometh in a great Difficulty. For, the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſian</hi> Princes being at laſt ſubdued by deceit, the Pope aſcended to the fulneſſe of his kingdom, and continued
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:113414:31"/>in his ſtrength, except onely interruptions of Temporal calamities, until the time of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> after which time his kingdom properly ſo called, began to be darkned, and his ſtrength Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual to be ſhaken effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually. Wherefore it is a very doubtful Queſtion, and concerning which I cannot poſſibly be reſolved at the preſent; Whether the Reſtauration of the Church out of <hi>Babylon</hi> Spiritual, here ſpoken of by <hi>Daniel,</hi> is not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begun from the time of <hi>Wickliff.</hi> Eſpecially, ſeeing that from the time of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> as well as from the time of <hi>Waldus,</hi> the firſt diviſion of yeers, that is, the Seven weeks or Fourty nine yeers, will preciſely run out in the erection of a Political Meſſiah. For the Reſtauration by the Word and Doctrine, began from the yeer 1370, at leaſt according to the round number, and was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the hand of <hi>Wickliff</hi> and his followers until the yeer 1419, when <hi>Ziſca</hi> in <hi>Bohemia</hi> was ſet up for a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Meſſiah and Defender of the Churches reformed and ſeparated from Antichriſt. After which time, though all the ſucceſſors of <hi>Ziſca</hi> were not reformed, yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches lived under them defended and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt the violence of Antichriſt, until the time of <hi>Luther,</hi> when greater ſtrength and ſecurity came in. Neither did Antichriſt ever after <hi>Wickliff</hi> ſo recover himſelf, as after <hi>Waldus</hi> he had done. Wherefore let this ſecond way of accommodation be equally conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until the events of time neer approaching ſhall ſhew which of the two ways before mentioned is rather to be choſen.</p>

                        <hi>ANd Sixty and two weeks</hi>] The Sixty and two weeks of yeers added to the Seven precedent, if the whole Seventy begin from 1160, will begin at the yeer 1209, and ſo will end in the yeer 1642. But if the Seventy weeks begin from 1370, then the Sixty two will begin from the riſing up of <hi>Ziſca,</hi> and will not end as yet by the ſpace of about Two hundred yeers. The like difficulty there is about the yeers of Antichriſt, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter. Now during the ſpace of the ſaid Seven and Sixty two weeks, it is ſaid, that <hi>the ſtreet ſhall be built, and the wall;</hi> that is, of the Church reſtored and edified by the Ordinances of Chriſt and Word of truth.

                     <p>¶ <hi>And the people of the Prince that ſhall come, ſhall deſtroy the City and the Sanctuary</hi>] The Prince that ſhall come, is Antichriſt: and his people, that is, the Papiſts and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtians, ſhall deſtroy the City and Sanctuary; that is, ſome of the Church Evangelical, the City and Sanctuary of Chriſt, according to the viſible appearance thereof in publike Worſhip and external Ordinances. So much I conceive is held out unto us in the fall and lying dead of the Two Witneſſes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.8. But what ſlaughter of men ſhall be, it is not ſaid expreſly: and onely a ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the publiek ſtate of the Church, and of the open exerciſe of Worſhip, and in ſome parts onely, may haply be underſtood.

But it is not in our power, for deſire of good unto the Church, to alter the Truth of God; neither can it be faithfulneſſe in us to violence or force upon the Word an unnatural Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation: and beſides, ſuch preſumption would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely prejudicial to the honour of God, and to the welfare of his people.

                     <p>¶ <hi>Even until the conſummation, and that determined, be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon the deſolate</hi>] It is ſaid to be determined, becauſe preciſely cut out or limited, as the Seventy weeks in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Verſ. 24, to be ended at the end of them. Until this end, from the beginning of the One thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty days, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.36, and principally from the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113414:34"/>midſt of the laſt week, the conſumption muſt be poured out upon the deſolate. And ſo at the end of the Seventy weeks, the Tranſgreſſion or Antichriſtian Apoſtacie being made an end of, and ſins conſumed, and iniquity purged, by the Spirit and Word, and by judgement or affliction, everlaſting and glorious righteouſneſſe muſt follow, and the erection of the high kingdom of Saints, foretold in the Prophets and Viſions of the Old Teſtament, and the Unction of the myſtical Altar for the bringing of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will-Offerings in righteouſneſſe, and pure and holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the beauties of holineſſe. So Verſe 24.</p>
                     <p>Now if the Seventy weeks begin from <hi>Waldus,</hi> that is, from the yeer 1106, then this laſt &amp; doleful week will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin preciſely in 1643, and the midſt of the ſaid week will be in 1646; from which yeer the three days and half of laſt affliction will run down to be fully ended in the yeer 1649. Proportionately, if the One thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty yeers of the reign of Antichriſt begin from the yeer 390, which is one way of accommodation, as ſhall be ſhewed; then they will preciſely expire alſo in the ſaid yeer 1649, and ſo will end together with the Seventy weeks or Four hundred and ninety yeers.</p>
                     <p>But if the Seventy weeks begin from <hi>Wickliff,</hi> or from the yeer 1370, then the laſt week cannot be expecteed, till Seven yeers immediately to come before the yeer 1860, that is, above Two hundred yeers hence. And proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately, if the One thouſand two hundred and ſixty yeers of the reign of Antichriſt begin from the yeer 600, which is the ſecond way of accommodation, as ſhall be ſhewed; then they will preciſely expire alſo immediately before the ſaid yeer 1860, that is, preciſely with the Seventy weeks according to their ſecond accommodation.</p>
                     <p>The probabilities of both ways are ſuch, that I muſt profeſſe I cannot judge or determine which of the twain
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113414:34"/>is to be followed. Howbeit I thought it needful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my thoughts. Two or three yeers will determine the Controverſie as yet undetermined.</p>

                     <head>An Anſwer to an Objection.</head>
                     <p>BUt againſt all that hath been ſaid, it will be objected, that in this preſent Prophecie, anſwer was given unto <hi>Daniel</hi> as he read the Prophecie of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaking of the material reſtitution of the Jews after Seventy yeers Captivity, and as he prayed for the accompliſhment thereof; and therefore that the reſtitution of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> here ſpoken of, muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of that which went before the firſt coming of our Saviour.</p>
                     <p>This Objection doth not move my judgement at all; foraſmuch as I am convinced of the uſe and cuſtom of the Prophets, who bring in types and figures ordinarily, and touch them a little onely, making way cloſely and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly thereby to ſpeak of greater things ſhadowed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. and 37.30, 31. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.2, 3. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72 and 89, &amp;c. So <hi>Daniel</hi> here caſt his thoughts on the Reſtauration out of <hi>Babylon</hi> temporal; but cloſely under it he was by the Spirit led to the Reſtauration out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> ſpiritual. Beſides, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> himſelf ſpeaking of the Reſtauration after Seventy yeers, doth myſtically imply, and under figures deſcribe the Reſtauration out of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſpiritual, as the paſſages <hi>Jer.</hi> 29, and 33, and 50, and 51, do ſhew, and the Apocalyptical accommodations make evident: <hi>Daniel</hi> therefore enquiring into the Prophecie of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> concerning the Reſtauration of the Church, enquired not onely after the Reſtauration of the Jews, but after the Reſtauration of the Church in general, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113414:35"/>glorious and ſpiritual, principally intended and deſired of all Saints; and therefore was led by the Spirit of God to the Reſtauration out of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſpiritual, as ſutable moſt unto his prayers and inquiſitions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Daniel</hi> faſted and prayed afterward, as Chap. 10, ſo as here he is deſcribed; and yet anſwers are given him at large concerning Antichriſt and the ſtate of the Church in the laſt times,

So here, Chriſt, the man clothed in linen, ſtandeth on the waters of the River, as Governour of all Nations, Tongues and People, <hi>Apo.</hi> 17.2, 15, and from the water ſpeaketh, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.6, 7, and uttereth the voice of his words, Chap. 10.9: what theſe words were, is not here expreſſed; but by comparing, they may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the ſame with thoſe, Chap. 8.16, bidding <hi>Gabriel</hi> to draw neer and ſpeak unto the Prophet.

                     <head>Sect. 4. <hi>Of the</hi> Roman <hi>Kingdom. The firſt and Heathen State thereof. From</hi> Verſe 14. to the 20.</head>
                     <head type="sub">The controverſal part.</head>
                     <p>THe common and received opinion is, That the <hi>Grecian</hi> Kings are not broken off at the 14. Verſe, but their Hiſtory continued in the Verſes following. And that they are continued to Verſe 36. all Authours that ever I ſaw, do with one conſent, without ſcruple affirm. And from the 36. Verſe alſo to the end, ſome extend their deſcription: Others ſay, the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours do there ſucceed; others, the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the honour of Chriſt and of this Prophecy; for the farther revelation of Antichriſt, and confirmation of the Saints, I am forced here to leave the common opinion: From which I have not wilfully and raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unreaſonably departed, but upon much ſtudy and weighing of Arguments.</p>
                     <p>And firſt I think, that the deſcription of the Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> begins at the 14. Verſe, reaching to the 20. which I prove by theſe Arguments.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe <hi>Amiochus Magnus</hi> was immediately ſpoken of before, and his Hiſtory deſcribed: in whoſe time the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Kingdom overflowed to the Mountain <hi>Taurus.</hi> Hence I frame an Argument by congruous proportion. For if <hi>Xerxes</hi> is the laſt <hi>Perſian</hi> King mentioned, Verſe 3. becauſe he oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the firſt entrance to the riſing of the next Monarchy, although ſundry other <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings came after him. Why may not <hi>Antiochus Magnus</hi> be the laſt montioned of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Kings of the North, becauſe he occaſioned the riſing of the next Monarchy, even to the overflowing of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts of the Kingdom of <hi>Graecia?</hi> And now the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Captain having overflowed the North, and being now
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:113414:41"/>made by Conqueſts King of the North, who but he in the next Verſes following ſhould be King of the North? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides there is no cauſe to pretend an abrupt introduction of a new King of the North; for he is brought in with a fair tranſition thus: At that time many ſhall ſtand up againſt the K. of the South, a time deſcribed to be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> the end of times, yeers: A phraſe arguing a fatal time of change and alteration, Verſe 13.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe the paſſages in the Verſes following, will not in any propriety agree to the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae.</hi> And in particular it cannot be ſhewed according to Verſe 14. how many ſtood up againſt the King of the South in <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> the Great, otherwiſe then before. Some affirm it is ſo ſaid, becauſe <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> made a Covenant with <hi>Antiochus:</hi> But he was not able to defend himſelf againſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> And moreover the Prophet ſpeaketh of ſuch a ſtanding up of many, as was ſucceſſeful to the overthrowing of the South, <hi>Judea</hi> firſt, and afterwards of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Others affirm it is ſo ſaid, becauſe the Jews did joyn themſelves to the ſuccour of <hi>Antiochus, Joſeph. Anti. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. But <hi>Joſephus</hi> there affirmeth, that <hi>Judea</hi> was variouſly caught up, ſometimes for the one ſide ſometimes for the other. Beſides it is againſt <hi>Judea,</hi> and againſt the Jews, and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> againſt whom many are affirmed to ſtand up, Verſe 15, 16, 17.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, How ſhall that be verified of the time of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> the Great, that the robbers of the Jews did ſtand up to eſtabliſh the Viſion, but fell? What were theſe robbers? What is the Viſion which they did eſtabliſh? How did they fall in the time of <hi>Antiochus?</hi> Some ſay, they were thoſe that followed <hi>Onias</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> to build a Temple there,

<note place="margin">Junius. Rolloc. Piſcator.</note> But how to eſtabliſh the Viſion? That is, they ſay to verifie this preſent Viſion, that prophecieth thereof. But ſo theſe words might have equally been affixed to any other part of this or other Prophecies. For all are indifferently written to be verified. Beſides an end ſo common and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſeemeth not needful to have been mentioned, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch a Prophecy ſo admirably compacted of the chief heads of ſubſtantial events. <hi>Junius</hi> turneth the word <gap reason="foreign">

For which Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Hebrew phraſe, I ſee no probability in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the circumſtances of this place.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, I finde not in Hiſtory ſuch a deſtruction of the Jews to have been made by <hi>Antiochus Magnus,</hi> as is here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in theſe words, <hi>but they ſhall fall,</hi> Verſe 14, and Verſe 16. <hi>he ſhall ſtand in the pleaſant land, which by his hand ſhall be conſumed.</hi> For this is the proper and ordinary ſenſe of <gap reason="foreign">

Fifthly, So great a preparation, ſuch ſieges, ſuch hoſtile wars againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> as are deſcribed, Verſ. 15, 16. are not appliable to <hi>Antiochus Magnus,</hi> to whom the <hi>Jews</hi> did voluntarily yeeld themſelves, as to a kinde and courteous Governour and Protectour of them. Neither ſuch a power is competible unto him, as is altogether irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible, propoſed in ſuch phraſes, Verſe 15, 16. as are given to irreſiſtible Conquerours: As to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Chap. 8.4. to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> Chap. 11.4. to Antichriſt, Chap. 11.36. For <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> got and loſt, got and loſt, by courſe: Neither like a floud did he over-run the Dominions of the King of the South, but ſome parts onely. The phraſes here propoſed, ſeem greater and of an higher ſtrain, then any formerly given to the greateſt Conquerours.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, It is not ſufficiently declared, how upright, or juſt, or favourable men were with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and for what end, and how he gave his daughter, to deſtroy or corrupt her; how ſhe was the daughter of women; how he took many in the Iſles of the Sea; how he ſo fell, that he was found no more; how the remover of the oppreſſour came into his place. Verſ. 17, 18, 19, 20. The application of theſe paſſages to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> cannot but ſeem ſtrained and forced, to a tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, impartial, and adviſed judgement.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, The paſſages here attributed to the King of the North, cannot poſſibly but be directed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. As that the <hi>Jews</hi> exalted or lifted up themſelves in Rebellion againſt it, thinking thereby to eſtabliſh and bring to effect the Viſion of the Prophets: That they fell in utter and conſuming deſtruction, as the phraſes do import. No other King of the North beſides the <hi>Romans,</hi> did after the time of <hi>Daniel,</hi> bring an utter deſolation on the <hi>Jews,</hi> and on their Land. All the other paſſages alſo in the Verſes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will moſt congruouſly agree to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as may be ſeen in the Explication.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:113414:43"/>
Eightly, Antichriſt or the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> is ſo plainly and ſo punctually deſcribed from the 21 Verſe downward, that it cannot be called into queſtion by him, that ſeriouſly and judiciouſly conſidereth it. Now the courſe, order, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the changes of the world being ſhewed here to <hi>Daniel,</hi> from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy to the laſt time: It was meet, and congruous, that before the deſcription of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ſhould be deſcribed, as which brought in the greateſt and moſt famous changes that ever were before: And if it be prefixed before Antichriſt, then muſt it here begin at the 14. Verſe, or elſe I ſee not what place can poſſibly be found for it.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, In the other Prophecies and Viſions of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> is deſcribed, repreſented by the Iron legs, Chap. 2.40. And by the fourth Beaſt with Iron teeth, Chap. 7.7, 8. As Iron breaking all in pieces, and devouring the whole Earth. Now if in theſe Viſions it is deſcribed, and as a moſt notable part therein: How much more in this Viſion, the greateſt, largeſt, nobleſt of all the reſt? Beſides in thoſe other Prophecies, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is deſcribed, immediately before Antichriſt: And why not proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably here alſo? Nay much rather, as hath been ſhewed.</p>

                        <p>Now to return to the matter. The oppreſſour was the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> whereby the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was overthrown and oppreſſed, as in the former Verſe. The remover of this oppreſſour began in <hi>Justinian</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, who brake down the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> by the yeer 556. From which time forward the Empire ſtood renewed and reſtored in ſome degree, until the time of <hi>Charls</hi> the Great, by whom was brought in a ſecond reſtauration more perfect, general, and laſting then the former, from after the yeer 768.</p>

                        <p>

                           <hi>but neither in wrath, nor in battel.</hi>] That is, by voluntary grant and donation of his power and authority to another King; whereby he ſhall break down himſelf, and not be broken down by violent extorſion: But this is eſpecially to be meant of the beginning and firſt entrance of his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, as it is expreſſed in the next Verſe.</p>
                        <p>The Succeſſour was Antichriſt the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> whom <hi>Justinian</hi> firſt decreed to be chief of Biſhops; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Phocas,</hi> willingly and without war or compulſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the yeer 606. that he ſhould be Univerſal Biſhop.</p>
                        <p>From which time forward, the Pope did ſo increaſe, that he became more forcible and powerful not onely in forrain Kingdoms, but alſo in <hi>Italy,</hi> then the Emperour himſelf. <hi>Charls</hi> the Great after the ſecond reſtauration, did the like, and much more, whereby it came to paſſe that the remover of the oppreſſour being in few dayes broken down by his own voluntary conceſſion, the Pope or Antichriſt did peaceably and without wrath or battle, ariſe into his place.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:113414:48"/>I require ſatisfaction of the Authours concerning theſe particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How he was a vile perſon, that is, baſe and of low degree, to whom they gave not the honour of a Kingdom, ſeeing he was the lawful ſon of <hi>Antiochus Magnus:</hi> Who (to uſe the words of <hi>Graſerus</hi>) was ſo great, even from his infancy, that then in the world known unto us, there was ſcarce another to be compared with him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I require a ſufficient reaſon, if this be <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> why as many or rather more words ſhould be ſpent upon him, then were ſpent upon all the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> before him: Whereof ſome were far more notable in exploits then he. If any ſay, that it is ſo, becauſe he was more notable in afflicting of the Saints: I ſtill demand, but why are ſo many words ſpent upon theſe warlike exploits that concerned not the Church? Beſides others before afflicted the Jewiſh Church not a little, and yet their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are not here mentioned. If his perſecutions did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, yet why ſhould the deſcription thereof exceed ſo much being but ſhort in duration, and not to be compared with thoſe of <hi>Nebuccadnezzar</hi> precedent, or thoſe of the <hi>Romans</hi> in the time following?</p>
                     <p>But if it be ſaid, the Reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Antiochus</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as the type of Antichriſt: I anſwer again, That the type howſoever muſt be according to truth, and the words of deſcription anſwerable to the things contained therein. The Holy Ghoſt would not repreſent Antichriſt by a type exceſſively deſcribed above the verity and proportion thereof.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I demand, how the greatneſſe of the matter and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits attributed to this King can be exhauſted in ſo ſlight acts, and ſo little momentoſe as thoſe of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> For he was in no war ſo happy, as that the phraſes here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed might be proportionate unto him. He had little or
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:113414:48"/>nothing more then the meaner ſort of the Kings of <hi>Syria.</hi>

Againſt the Jews he prevailed indeed at firſt: But afterward was ſhamefully overthrown by <hi>Judas Macchabaeus.</hi> He advanced his Armies into <hi>Perſia:</hi> But thence alſo was diſhonourably beaten back. Can it be ſaid of ſuch a King, that the Arms of inundation are overflown from before him, and Princes of the Covenant? Or that he doth that which his fathers have not done, nor his Fathers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Verſe 24. For theſe words are uttered of him abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and not as reſtrain'd to his <hi>Egyptian</hi> exploits: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in the ſimple nature and greatneſſe of devaſtations, he is ſuperlatively compared with all Predeceſſours. And how can this be verified of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes?</hi> And as for his <hi>Egyptian</hi> exploits (to uſe the words of <hi>Graſerus</hi>) it is manifeſt, That his father <hi>Antiochus</hi> did not leſſe exploits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Egypt</hi> it ſelf. Again I inſtance in Verſe 25, 26. where a mighty and extraordinary war is attributed to the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed, to the overflowing and breaking down of the Kingdom of the South; How can this be applyed to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Egypt?</hi> Into which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred twice, and with ſhort and little momentoſe ſucceſſe: Being both times at laſt ignominiouſly repulſed: The firſt time, by the Captains of <hi>Ptolemaeus;</hi> the ſecond time, by the onely words and command of the <hi>Roman</hi> Embaſſadour <hi>Popi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi> And I inſtance in the phraſe mentioned Verſe 25. that the King of the South did not ſtand by reaſon of him, that is, was overthrown and his Kingdom diſſolved, as the phraſe is uſed, Verſe 15, 16. Chap. 8.4. How will that alſo be applied to him Verſe 27. That his end ſhould be at a time appointed? As if his victorious overflowing continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til a certain period of times. How that alſo Verſe 28. that from the Conqueſt of the King of the South, he is ſaid to return with great ſubſtance, to do and return to note a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:113414:49"/>in proſperous ſucceſſe, in going and returning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repulſe. Again, that Verſe 29. that his ſecond expedition was not proſperous as the firſt: whereby is ſignified that the laſt being unproſperous, the firſt was proſperous: whereas in the former expedition of <hi>Antiochus</hi> he had a repulſe by the Captains of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> as <hi>Nauclerus</hi> expreſſeth, and in the latter he ſeemeth to have done more then in the former. And if <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore I conclude, that the greatneſſe of the ſtile and of the warlike exploits here ſpoken off, cannot be exhauſted in the petty wars of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes:</hi> Neither the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of this Prophecy can be verified in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his exploits.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I demand, who is the Prince of the Covenant, Verſe 22. called the Holy Covenant Verſe 28, 30, 32. which by this King is ſaid to be overflown and broken down: And how, and in whom it is applyable to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> Some ſay, he is <hi>Seleucus Philopator</hi> King of <hi>Syria;</hi> Others, that it is <hi>Ptolemaeus Philometor</hi> King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> called the Prince of the Covenant, by reaſon of the Covenant which <hi>Antiochus</hi> made with them.

Neither can he be <hi>Ptolemaeus Philometor:</hi> For how was he overflown and broken down by <hi>Antiochus?</hi> How again could either he or <hi>Seleucus</hi> be called the Prince of the Covenant: For this is not a phraſe uſual or ſuteable to ſignifie a confederate.

Wherefore neither can he be diſpoſed and complicated with Antichriſt as the Type with the Antitype: Foraſmuch as the words of a Prophecy muſt

                     <p>Secondly, the manner and matter of this deſcription, is exactly the ſame with the deſcription of the little Horn, who undoubtedly is Antichriſt.

The deſcription of <hi>Daniel</hi> argueth a ſubduing of many and mighty Nations. Could all theſe Hiſtorians omit ſo notable an Expedition in the Hiſtory of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> if any ſuch had been?</p>
                     <p>Eightly, it is not likely, that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould end this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in <hi>Antiochus;</hi> ſeeing the calamities of the very Jewiſh Nation ended not with him.

                     <p>Ninthly, how did <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſubdue all other Nations and countries about <hi>Judea,</hi> ſave onely <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> and the chief of the children of <hi>Ammon?</hi> As if thoſe three were alſo his Enemies, whereas they were his helpers.</p>

Then <hi>v.</hi> 40. he ſaith, the ruine of the Empire is deſcribed; firſt, by the wars of the Saraſins, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of King of the South; then by the wars of the Turks, under the title of King of the North. Againſt which Expoſition I propound theſe difficulties following:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, how did the Roman Empire before Antichriſt, diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the deſire of women? <hi>v.</hi> 37. Anſwer is made, Becauſe the Emperors children were not made Succeſſors in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, according to the deſire of their mothers; Succeſſors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing promiſcuouſly choſen, according to the pleaſure of the Souldiers. But it is expreſly ſaid, that <hi>The King ſhall not regard the deſire of women, v.</hi> 36, 37. which, if it be ſpoken of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, muſt eſpecially reſpect the Emperour thereof. But how can it be imagined, that the Roman Emperor ſhould not be willing, and deſire to have his children Succeſſors in the Empire? Though the Souldiers did otherwiſe, what is this to the deſire of the King? And why ſhould the preferment of children in the Kingdom, be called in ſo generall and remote a deſcription, <hi>The deſire of women?</hi> &amp; why the deſire of women rather then the deſire of men? and of the children themſelvs?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>He ſhall honour the god of ſtrong holds, and the god which his fathers knew not;</hi> it is thought, that in theſe words one onely God is ſignified, and this the true God of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> But the true God it cannot be, becauſe this King is ſaid to honour this God; but contrarily, to advance himſelf, and ſpeak great things againſt the true God, which is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:113414:60"/>the God of gods, <hi>verſ.</hi> 36. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.25. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.25.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if theſe victorious wars and conqueſts, deſcribed <hi>v.</hi> 40. ſhould be the Turkiſh wars, and no more ſaid of the Roman Empire, then the Prophecy of the Roman Empire ſhould be begun and not ended, Antichriſt not mentioned; the end of the Turk propoſed, not of the Roman Empire; and this Prophecy ſhould be unproportionable to all other which ſpeak eſpecially of Antichriſt, and of his end.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="13" type="section">
                     <head>Sect. 13. <hi>That the King, whoſe Wars are deſcribed</hi> v. 40. <hi>is Antichrist, I prove by theſe Arguments following.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. BEcauſe the Hiſtory of Antichriſt being ſo largely ſet down before, it is conſonant that his end ſhould alſo be ſet down, the cauſes, manner, fore-runners of it; which would not be, unleſſe the Expeditions following belonged unto An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Expeditions following, are in revenge of the puſh inferred by the King of the South; and therefore they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him that was puſhed at by him, which is Antichriſt, immediately ſpoken of before.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Author of theſe Expeditions, is the King of the North; and the King of the North before mentioned, is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, as appeareth by comparing <hi>v</hi> 15.20, 21, 25, 36. <hi>c.</hi> 8.9.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is not probable, that it ſhould be ſaid, that the King of the South ſhould puſh at Antichriſt, and no more added of his war, a diverſion following to the Hiſtory of the Turks.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Expeditions here ſpoken of, are in the time of the end, <hi>v.</hi> 40. when the ſtanding up of <hi>Michael</hi> is at hand, <hi>c.</hi> 12.11. and what are thoſe famous wars in the time of the end, thoſe great &amp; laſt attempts againſt the Church, <hi>v.</hi> 44, &amp;c. ſpoken of in other Prophecies, but thoſe that are attributed to <hi>Antichriſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The fall and laſt wars of Antichriſt, are more nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and more needfull to be known, then the wars and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:113414:61"/>downfall of any other King; and therefore it is not likely that the laſt war and downfall of another King, ſhould be here deſcribed, and Antichriſts pretermitted.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Daniel</hi> in all his other Viſions and Prophecies, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and accurately ſet down the fall of Antichriſt, <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 9. and therefore it is not likely, that in this Prophecy, being the largeſt and exacteſt of all the reſt, he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it; which yet he ſhould conceal, if theſe Expeditions were not his.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. His end, verſ. 45. and the end of his wonders, c. 12.5. is at the end of a time, two times and a half, c. 12.5, 7. which is the term of Antichriſt his raign, as appeareth, c. 7.25. with <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.14. and 13.5, 6.</p>

                     <p>BY reaſon of the deſcription of Antichriſt, repeated from Verſe 36. his wars here ſeem alſo to be repeated: And for this cauſe alſo, that by a certain order and methodicall courſe, the Prophet might deſcend to the deſcribing of his utter deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Verſe 40. <hi>But in the time of the end, the King of the South ſhall puſh at him</hi>] The time of the end in the larger ſenſe is with <hi>Daniel</hi> that time when Antichriſt began to aſcend to a notable increaſe of his power and Kingdom, as from the times of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and more fully from the times of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> as it is expreſſely ſaid, Chap. 8.17. Yet in a ſtricter ſenſe, the time of the end is that time wherein the yeers of Antichriſt are finiſhed, Chap. 11.35.45. The King of the South by an Enallage of the number, ſignifieth the Mahometan Kings and Princes, whether of the <hi>Saraſins</hi> or <hi>Turks.</hi> The <hi>Saraſins</hi> firſt fought with Antichriſt from the yeer 840, and by little and little, other cauſes alſo together adjoyned, inflicted on him his deadly plagues, whereof men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, <hi>Ap.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Machiah. Flor. Hiſt.</hi> That plague or deadly wound was by little and little healed, the <hi>Saraſins</hi> being caſt out of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and more yet by that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into <hi>Africk</hi> againſt them in the yeer 1087. <hi>Sigon.</hi> and laſtly more perfectly by that great expedition againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saraſins</hi> in the Eaſt, about the yeer 1097. The wound was alſo healed, in the overthrow of all other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, through the ſucceſſefull atchievements of <hi>Otho</hi> the Great and his followers. Now by thoſe expeditions, and eſpecially by the laſt againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saraſins</hi> in the Eaſt, the King of the North, that is, Antichriſt, ruſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Mahometans like a whirlewind, with Charets and Horſes, and with great fleets or with many ſhips, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:113414:63"/>flowed and paſſed thorow. At length he came into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-land (as they call) or into <hi>Judea,</hi> called the pleaſant land, many Countries falling under him. He came into the <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at the laſt term of his inundation: Seeing that he touched not the land of <hi>Edom,</hi> nor the land of <hi>Moab,</hi> neither the beginning of the children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> that is, not ſo much as the firſt or outmoſt borders of them. Wherefore theſe, and not the other Countries adjoyned, did Antichriſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due. Or happily the land of the children of <hi>Ammon</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> the beginning, in relation to the land of <hi>Moab</hi> and the land of <hi>Edom:</hi> Becauſe among thoſe three Countries, the land of <hi>Ammon</hi> did lye next unto the North, as a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Countries, firſt obvious to the Latines coming from the North. So that although the land of <hi>Ammon</hi> as a beginning of the other Countries, did firſt lie open unto Antichriſt, yet it is affirmed that it ſhould eſcape out of his hands: The <hi>Holy-land</hi> only ſubdued and taken out of the hands of the Infidels, which was the main thing intended in this expedition:</p>
                     <p>Furthermore it is added, that Antichriſt ſhould not only ſubdue the Countries, but alſo ſhould ſtretch forth his hand upon them, and pillage them and carry away the ſpoyls of them, Verſe 42, 43. and ſo indeed he did in the foreſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. And in this reſpect, as alſo in reſpect of overthrow and ſlaughter the land of Egypt did not eſcape, Verſe 42. For in the laſt proceedings of this firſt expedition, to wit, at <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> he had power over the treaſures of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and over all the pleaſant things of the Egyptians, and of the <hi>Lybians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> alſe, which are wont to be joyned with the Egyptians in wars, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 12.2, 3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 30.5. <hi>Ier.</hi> 40.9. I conceive, that firſt and great expedition of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt here only to be deſcribed, which was ended or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in the foreſaid victory over the Egyptians. In that laſt victory (ſaith <hi>Paulus Aemylius</hi>) more then a hundred

So great prey was taken there as was not taken before, though all the battles in this war that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were put together. So (ſaith he) the Turkiſh war being ended, the Egyptians being ſlain, a yoke being put upon the Eaſt, the Nobles returned home full of glory and riches. So before to the ſame effect, Verſe 26.28.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I come now to the ſecond point intended; to ſhew that it is poſſible, needfull, yea required, that by theſe Characters we ſhould ſearch out the accommodation of the years. But here a great difficulty doth ariſe, which in the firſt place muſt be removed. For our Saviour in his anſwer to the Apoſtles, asking the time of the reſtoring of Iſrael, ſaith, that <hi>It was not for them to know the times and ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his own hands,</hi> Act. 1.6, 7. Whereby he ſeemeth to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that the exact time and year of the reſtoring of Iſrael, that is, of the beginning of the Kingdom of the Saints, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:113414:65"/>deſtruction of Antichriſt, is hidden and unknown, and not to be made manifeſt to man. If this be ſo, then either the foreſaid years are not determined for the bringing in of this effect, contrary to that which hath been ſhewed: or elſe they are ſo at leaſt propoſed in Scripture, that yet they ſhall never be ſearched out, nor known by man, untill the end is fully come. Again, <hi>Matthew</hi> 24.36. our Saviour having ſpoken of the laſt time, wherein the Enemy ſhall be deſtroyed, and the Kingdom of the Saints ariſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 29, 33. ſubjoyneth, <hi>But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the Angels of Heaven, but my Father onely.</hi> Which is alſo farther amplified and confirmed by that which followeth, <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>For as the dayes of Noah, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be:</hi> For as in the dayes before the Flood, they did eat and drink, &amp;c. and knew nothing, till the Flood came and ſwept them all away; <hi>ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be:</hi> Which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> confirmeth alſo, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. <hi>But of the times and ſeaſons (Brethren) ye need not that I write unto you: For you your ſelves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord ſhall come as a thief in the night; For when they ſhall ſay Peace and ſafety; then ſhall come upon them ſudden deſtruction.</hi> Whereunto may be added that which is ſaid of the laſt afflictions of the Church, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 74.9. <hi>We ſee not our ſigns, there is not one Prophet more, nor any with us that knoweth how long.</hi> Laſtly, the uncertainty of the time is made by Chriſt an argument to ſtir us up to watchfulneſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.40. <hi>Be ye therefore ready alſo, for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.</hi> So <hi>Mark</hi> 13. verſe 35. <hi>Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the maſter of the houſe cometh, at Even, or at Midnight, or at the Cock-crowing, or at the Morning, lest coming ſuddenly, he finde you ſleeping. And what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, Watch.</hi> So <hi>Matthew</hi> 24.42. <hi>Wake therefore, for yee know not what hour your Maſter will come.</hi>
                     </p>

For anſwer unto theſe Scriptures, I ſay as followeth; Firſt to <hi>Act.</hi> 1.6, 7. that it was not for the Apoſtles or any of that age, to know the time of the reſtoring of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is for them to know it that live in the laſt age. The Father alſo hath reſerved it in his own power, howbeit in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect onely of ſuperiour ages, from which he purpoſed to conceal it; not in reſpect of the laſt age, whereunto he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to reveal it. So in like manner, it was not for <hi>Daniel</hi> to ſearch and underſtand the time, two times and a half at the end whereof the Kingdom muſt begin to be ſet up; howbeit theſe times are to be unſealed to the laſt age, about the time of the end, as it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7, 8, 9, 10. Unto that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.36. and the other paſſages annexed, I anſwer two wayes; Firſt, as for the wicked, the day, the hour, the time, the year, is to be hidden from their foreknowledge. And this our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour intendeth, when he compares the times of <hi>Noah,</hi> and when he ſaith, that day ſhould come upon them as a ſnare, and the like. See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.37, 39. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. For <hi>Noah</hi> did foreknow the year of the Flood, though the wicked did not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. and ſo in the laſt times the Saints ſhall underſtand, when none of the wicked ſhall underſtand, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.10. Secondly, as concerning the Saints, our Saviour doth not ſimply and abſolutely deny unto them the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of the time; for he knew that the time was to be revealed to his Saints, near unto the end, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4, 10. But he denyeth it onely to the Saints preſent, and far diſtant from the end; to whom it was to be unknown, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4, 9, 10. And for this end, leſt the long diſtance ſhould cauſe ſecurity; therefore our Saviour doth accordingly propoſe the time, as for the preſent hidden, and maketh uſe alſo of the end for which it was hidden, by dehorting from ſecurity, and ſtirring up to watchfulneſſe. But as for the Saints of the laſt age, the foreknowledge of the end cannot occaſion unto them ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to whom it is not far off, but rather watchfulneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:113414:66"/>it is near. And therefore as in the time of Chriſt, the Saints were to be ſtirred up to watchfulneſſe, becauſe the time of the end was unknown: ſo now they are to be ſtirred up to watchfulneſſe, becauſe the time of the end is known. <hi>Being then far off;</hi> and therfore if known, apt to hinder watchfulnes: <hi>Now near;</hi> and therefore by knowledge apt to cauſe it.</p>
                     <p>Unto <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.9. firſt it may be queſtioned, Of what time the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaketh. Secondly, If he ſpeaketh of the laſt time; then either of thoſe, unto whom the light of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies hath not yet fully ſhined: or in compariſon with precedent times, when they had Prophets extraordinarily and immediately ſent unto them: whereas now they ſhould have none ſuch, but only mediate and ordinary teachers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering conjecturall interpretations of numbers myſtically involved. Thirdly, the complaint may be, not of the want of knowledge ſimply, but of the loſſe and great ſlaughter of the teachers, by whom knowledge of the times was manifeſted.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, although the uncertainty of the time is made by Chriſt an argument to ſtir us up to watchfulneſſe, yet this hindreth not, but that the yeer of the end or at leaſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity may be known to the Saints in the laſt age. For the time was abſolutely uncertain to the preſent age wherein Chriſt ſpake; and therefore unto it, the abſolute uncertainty of the end might and ought to be applied, as a provocation and incentive unto watchfulneſſe.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, becauſe thoſe years are parts of that propheſie,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:113414:67"/>and of thoſe things to come, which God the Father gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Son, to ſend and ſhew unto his ſervants, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.1. Chriſt did not ſend to ſhew the matter without the ſenſe: but that it ſhould be underſtood: therefore we muſt ſearch to underſtand.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe it is ſaid of all the propheſie, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the times therein contained, bleſſed is he that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and they that hear this words of this propheſie, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.3.

                     <p>Fourthly, to come neer, our Saviour alledging the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> concerning the abomination of deſolation, whereby the foreſaid times are declared and characterized, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.31. c. 12.11. addeth with all <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Fifthly, as the time of the end is neerer at hand, ſo the propheſie, and conſequently the times included are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſealed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22.10. and 1, 3.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, I argue expreſly from <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. where the time, two times and halfe being propoſed, Verſe 7. and <hi>Daniel</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing he underſtood not, Verſe 8. an anſwer is given, Verſe 9. that the words were ſealed up till the time of the end, that is, untill the laſt time immediately before the end, as the phraſe is uſed, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.7. Therefore in the time immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the end, thoſe words are to be unſealed, which is farther proved by Verſe 10. Many ſhall be tried, made white, and purified, but none of the wicked ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:113414:67"/>but the wiſe ſhall underſtand. And it is farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Verſe following, where what they ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand at that time in particular, is more fully ſignified and from the time (ſaith the Angel) that the dayly ſacrifice ſhall be taken away, and the abomination making deſolate ſet up, ſhall be 1290 dayes.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, I argue from the end intended in ſetting down theſe years, which was (as learned <hi>Napier</hi> ſpeaketh) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſecurity, and move unto repentance. The knowledge of the end (ſaith he) hath been concealed from former ages, to prevent ſecurity: but it is to be revealed to the laſt age, to move unto repentance.

The weak and dark beginning of the ſignes, was before the year 400. the more evident, open and perfect ſtate thereof, about the year 600. I know no other way but theſe two. For the former way theſe Arguments do ſtand.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Immediatly after the riſing under <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Dragon forced the woman into her place in the Wildernes, which muſt eſpecially be the <hi>Arrian</hi> perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhe came to her place in the ſtate of a Wildernes Spiritual through <hi>Arrianiſme,</hi> eſpecially about the year 360. and afterward through Antichriſtianiſme, eſpecially from about the year 390; and therefore here we may ſix the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the time, two times and half, according to <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.13, 14.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The years begun at the time, when the true Doctrine and Worſhip is ſolemnly taken away, and Hereſie and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry making the Church a Wildernes ſet up,

The Church was in the way of flight and ſeparation gradually before, but came not through Arrianiſme to her place in the ſtate of a Wildernes untill this time, as hath been ſaid: and therefore here may fitly be the beginning of the greater Number, to wit, 1290. But about the year 390, the Doctrine and Worſhip was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly corrupted by Antichriſt, and Antichriſtianiſme ſet

Now if Idolatry came in between 380. and 400. then about 390. And <hi>Syricius</hi> did all this about the year 390. I make little matter, that I cannot ſet down the preciſe year thereof exactly, ſeeing <hi>Syricius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan but about five years before to be in the ſeat of the Pope, and the holy Ghoſt ſeemeth not ſo much to look at the nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of numbers as alwayes to expreſſe the few broken pieces: but looketh eſpecially at the perfect and round number, which is the number decadical, and ſo the number 390. may be ſet down for the beginning of that which happily in ſome degree began three or four years before. See <hi>Corn. a Lap.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.12.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The years begin at the coming in of the Barbarians, which are the primitive ten horns: And as Arrianiſme came to its ſtrength about the year 360. ſo the Barbarians began at that time effectually and ſucceſſively to break in upon the Empire, judgement anſwering unto ſin. The Perſians made the firſt onſet, and in the iſſue took away five Provinces from the Roman Empire; and the bank being thus broken down,
<note place="margin">Ammia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> the whole flood of the Barbarians followed after, from about
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:113414:70"/>the year 364. After the year 378. there followed a ceſſation of the Arrian Hereſie and Perſecution, and therewithall a ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the irruptions of Barbarians for about ten years; and then the Antichriſtian Hereſie and Idolatry ſucceeding from about the year 390. the inundation of the Barbarians came in afreſh again, with a new and ſtronger beginning: So that from this time forward it could be no more interrupted, but continued and increaſed untill the Empire of the Weſt was utterly diſſolved.

So having divided the Empire into the ten Kingdoms, they corrupted the Church more then before; and laſtly, ſubjected their Kingdoms openly unto Antichriſt and to his Laws. So then the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall irruption of the Barbarians, beginning at 360. and again afreſh at 390. do alſo from the former term ſet a beginning to the years 1290. and from the latter term ſet a beginning to the years 1260. Now that the years muſt begin at the coming in of the Barbarians, and diſſipation of the Empire, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from theſe conſiderations:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is very probable, That Antichriſt aroſe in the coming in of the Barbarians, and diſſipation of the Empire. So ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly <hi>Serez</hi> the Author of the French Hiſtory, a man indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and impartiall, and of whom we have no cauſe to think that he looked at any other end in his Diſcourſe, but onely the reality of the thing in it ſelf, without reſpect to the Accommodation of the years. And thus he writeth, <hi>fol.</hi> 2. <hi>Damaſas, Syricius, Anaſtaſius Innocentius, Soſimus</hi> and <hi>Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> lived there one after the other, amidſt the confuſions of the Empire, and even at <hi>Rome:</hi> whereas
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:113414:70"/>the Emperors were ſeldom ſeen; ſo as the abſence of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, troubled to withſtand the Barbarians, &amp; the miſerable ſtate of the time, which forced Chriſtians to flye to their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop for counſell and comfort in their confuſed afflictions, laid the foundation of their authority, then ſmall, being tyed to their charges, and ſubject to the Emperours command: But it grew by degrees, untill it came to the height of this Soveraign and Abſolute power, ſo as in the end they have preſcribed Laws to the Emperours, Kings, and Chriſtian Princes. A neceſſary Obſervation, both for the truth and order of this Hiſtory, to underſtand rightly both the time and means of their riſing. In the firſt age, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> durſt not ſhew themſelves, being perſecuted, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and martyred by the Emperours. Since <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, their authority began in the diſſipation of the Empire, it increaſed eſpecially under <hi>Pipin</hi> and <hi>Charls</hi> the Great. Again at the year 514. thus the ſame Author writeth; The Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> thruſt himſelf forward amidſt theſe confuſions and ruines of the Empire, recovering that which the Emperours had loſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Antichriſt is the little horn, and he roſe at the ſame time, together with the ten horns, in low and dark beginnings, and the Primitive ten horns were the Northern Barbarians, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.8. It is true, he is ſaid afterward, Verſe 24. to ariſe after the ten Horns: but this may be ſaid in reſpect of the open and more perfect degree of his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Beaſt or Antichriſt is ſaid to receive his Kingdom at one hour, together with the ten horns, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.12.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The flood of the Dragon, which doth ſignifie the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Northern Barbarians, is expreſly ſet after the womans flight, and coming to her fixed ſeat in the ſtate of the Wilderneſſe; wherein ſhe is to ſit down, and to be hidden the ſpace of all the foreſaid years, the time, two times and half.

And ſo this number may onely comprehend the times of the moſt perfect raign of Antichriſt, deſcribed in that eighth chapter; beginning from the year 1075. when firſt <hi>Hildebrand</hi> took occaſion to exalt himſelf effectually above the Emperour, and promulged effectuall Decrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the unmarryed eſtate of the Clergy, and other Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip; and Antichriſt in him began of a little horn to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

                        <p>NOw that the Popes Kingdom, more properly ſo called, that is, the commanding, and effectuall and open ſtate thereof, and the more perfect ſtate of the foreſaid ſignes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, do ſet beginning to theſe years; the following Arguments will plead on the other ſide.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Beaſt or little horn, that is, the Pope, is ſaid expreſly to riſe into his Kingdom after the ten horns, being thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth about to raign the time, two times and half, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.24, 25. It will be anſwered, He roſe with them in reſpect of ſmall beginnings, but after them in reſpect of open manifeſtation of his Kingdom. See <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.12. But howſoever, thus much may be gathered, That according to this place, it will not be inconvenient or unreaſonable to begin the years of Antichriſt after the riſing of the ten horns, and from the manifeſtation
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:113414:72"/>and open power of his Kingdom, but rather very connaturall unto it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Beaſt is ſaid expreſly to riſe into his Kingdom, after the Dragons flood, and the drying up thereof, being about to raign 42. moneths, which ſignifie all the years of Antichriſt, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.16, 17, 18. with <hi>cap.</hi> 13.1, 5, 6. Now the Dragons flood was the flood of the Northern Barbarians; foraſmuch as the waters caſt out of his mouth, do properly ſignifie Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Tongues and People, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.15. flowing out upon the Church, at the mouth or ſuggeſtion of the Devil. Their flood was dryed up, partly when they were ſubdued by <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> partly when they were united with the earthly part of Chriſtendom in Antichriſtian Religion. It may be anſwered, That after this time indeed the Beaſt aroſe into the open ſtate and power of his Kingdom, in appearance according to the ſimilitude of other Kingdoms: But in ſmall and dark begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings that he began before; and that from thoſe ſmall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings his years are to be numbred, howſoever they be ſet down under the open ſtate thereof. Compare <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.14. with <hi>cap.</hi> 13.5, 6. But this will be ſufficient for our purpoſe, that it will be very conſonant and agrecable to this place, to begin the years of Antichriſt from his latter ſtate, and not unnaturall thereunto; howſoever we cannot prove that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is ſo.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, 1290. may begin in 570 according to the round number.

                        <p>Secondly, the 1260 yeers may fitly begin in the yeer 600. according to the round number.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:113414:73"/>Then began <hi>Gregory</hi> the Pope to command a litany for the invocation of Saints to be ſung publikely. Then (ſaith <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>) of a commemoration of Saints was made an invocation of them.

                        <p>Fifthly, the ſolution of the <hi>Turks,</hi> notwithſtanding this ſecond way may begin in the foreſaid yeer 1260. and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing 390 yeers may end immediately before 1650: or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

                        <p>THe Dragon is not ſimply the Devil, but with ſeven heads and ten horns, Chap. 12.3. that is, the Devil in the Roman Empire. He in his heathen eſtate or in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperours, had through all the Roman Empire ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Nations, C 12.9. to wit, with heatheniſme and in the way of oppoſition to the Church. But he was caſt down out of his throne in the times of Conſtantine, Chriſt then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king poſſeſſion of the throne together with the Saints, Chap. 12.5, 10. But he by the barbarous Nations as by many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters overflowing the Empire of the Weſt, and afterward ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and raiſing up Antichriſt, beginning openly to reign and with the Barbarians to ſubjugate the Church about the yeer 600. even now ſeemed about to obtain and to recover that amplitude of power and dominion, for the ſeducing of the Nations in his ſecond or Antichriſtian ſtate, which before he had obtained in his firſt or Ethnick ſtate.</p>
                        <p>This greatnes and efficacy of power that he might not yet obtain, he was forthwith by the ſix firſt plagues of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als more and more to be bound and impriſoned, as it were in a bottomleſſe pit, for the ſpace of a thouſand yeers: and thoſe thouſand yeers being ended, he is for a little ſpace to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Antichriſt, to obtain that power, at leaſt comparatively, which before he had in his Heathen ſtate. So then after theſe 1000 yeers he ſhall recover himſelf out of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:113414:74"/>plagues of the Vials, and having ſubdued the witheſſes in the Weſt, he ſhall go forth without impediment to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Nations againſt the holy City, and upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he ſhall come to an end by the ſeventh Viall.</p>
                        <p>The Dragon in Antichriſt and in the Antichriſtian horns, gradually aſcending to the height, the Saints or holy people began as it were to be beheaded, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.4. which phraſe I. believe is here applied for myſticall ſignification, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it was not uſuall or cuſtomary with Antichriſt to kill the Saints by ſuch a kind of death properly underſtood, but myſtically he beheaded them, by the word and cenſures wrongfully applied: pronouncing them to be ſchiſmaticks and hereticks, and ſo cut off from Chriſt as the body from the head, and then proſecuting them as excommunicate and cut off from Chriſt, with perſecutions, firſt of leſſer kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the times of <hi>Waldus,</hi> and after unto death.</p>
                        <p>The Saints in this eſtate aroſe in their own defence, and by the word and cenſures did as it were behead the Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, pronouncing them excommunicate and cut off from Chriſt, and thereby expoſed them unto the judgement of the Vials. Now God approved the word and ſentence in their mouths, and thereupon followed it with plagues, whereby the Dragon in the Antichriſtians ſhall be impriſoned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained a thouſand yeers unto the end of the ſixth Viall: And then a ſhort ſolution intervening for the gathering of all Nations, ſhall afterward be utterly cut off by the ſeventh Viall. Thus then the Saints did reign a thouſand yeers, to wit, by the word and propheſie, as it is alſo expreſſed, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.5, 6. and unto the foreſaid laſt ſolution of the Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans out of the bottomleſſe pit, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.7. and they reigned by bringing the Vialls in the way of propheſie, as it is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the ſame place, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.6. Thus alſo they are ſaid to reign as Prieſts of God and of Chriſt. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.7. that is, by the word and prayer. For in this manner Prieſts do uſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:113414:74"/>to reign: Therefore the Saints or Angels, which are the Miniſters of the ſeven Vials, are brought in clothed with fine linnen, which was the habit of the Prieſts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. and coming as Prieſts out of the Temple, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 15.5, 6. to pour them out by the word and prayer upon the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. And in this ſenſe they are ſaid to be ſet on thrones, and to have judgement put into their hands, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.4. which is the judgement of the ſeven Vials, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 14.7. and 15.4. and 16.7. Now whereas the Saints are ſaid to ſmite the Antichriſtians with ulcers and blood and fire, as in the four firſt Vials, and then to darken the Kingdom of Antichriſt, as in the fifth, and afterward to dry up the waters of his Kingdom in the ſixth: what is this, but at leaſt to bind and reſtrain the Dragon in the Antichriſtians? And we can alſo ſhew, that theſe ſix Vials, let the yeers of Antichriſt be meaſured which way you will, muſt continue the ſpace of a 1000 yeers. And expreſly after that theſe ſix Vials are ended, it is ſaid as after the end of the 1000 yeers, that the Dragon with the Beaſt is looſed to gather all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions together againſt the time of the laſt Viall. Compare, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 16.13, 14, 15. with <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.3, 8, 9.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two places, namely, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 11.5, 6, 7. <hi>and</hi> 16.13, 14. compared with, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 20.3, 8, 9. I ſuppoſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the anſwering of any objections, that may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to our interpretation. Whereunto may be added that in <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.24, 25, 26, 27. where the Church is brought in ſtanding and prevailing, that is, reigning all along from its firſt beginning untill the laſt week, which agreeth with the time of the ſolution of the Dragon for a little ſpace, at the end of his 1000 years. For we muſt underſtand theſe expreſſions, not in a ſenſe abſolute but comparative. And as the primitive Saints, notwithſtanding the ten ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Perſecutions, are brought in reigning and prevailing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:113414:75"/>more and more againſt the Heathen Emperours, to wit, by the word and prayer, the fight of faith and patience, accompanied with ſutable effects of the Goſpel and of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, untill they were utterly caſt down in the dayes of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> Apocalyps 6.1.2. with 12.9, 10, 11, 12. ſo notwithſtanding ſeverall guſts of Antichriſtian perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Saints being many times hurt, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 11.5. and many times beheaded as hath been ſaid, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 20.4. yet they riſe continually and prevaile and reign by the like means, ſaving only for a little ſpace at the looſing of the Dragon.</p>
                        <p>Let this be obſerved in concluſion, that we have not from neceſſity ſo interpreted that phraſe, beheaded for the teſtimony of Ieſus, as hath been explicated: for we may ſay with <hi>Paraeus,</hi> that any manner of death is ſignified thereby, and I adde, any manner of puniſhment and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in generall, infflicted upon Saints as hereticks and malefactours. Such was reproach and leſſer kinds of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution before the times of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and afterward the puniſhment of death. And notwithſtanding all this, they are ſaid to riſe and live and reign, partly in themſelves and partly in their ſucceſſours and members of the ſame body ſpirituall, and by propheticall and prieſtly power to bring the conſtant judgement of the Vials upon the Antichriſtians, to the retarding and reſtraining of the Dragon in them, unto the end of the 1000 years.</p>
                        <p>But as concerning the Antichriſtians and the Dragon in them, it is ſaid of them that they ſhould be ſo killed by the prieſtly power of the Saints, being dead ſpiritually, and cenſured to be as dead by propheſie, and thereupon given up to the plagues of judgement: that they, being the reſidue of the dead ſpoken of, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 20.5. ſhould not live again, untill the thouſand yeers be expired. Which
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:113414:75"/>is to be underſtood either of the more generall converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſpirituall reſurrection, whereby the remnant of Antichriſtians ſhall ariſe at the end of the 1000 years and of the years of Antichriſt: or of the reſurrection of the dead properly ſo called, which ſhall follow after the ſaid years, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 20.8, 12. or of the Antichriſtians cut off and ſlain by the conſtant plagues of the ſix former Vials, through the whole ſpace of the 1000 years, and not ariſing perfectly or breathing out of them, untill after the end of the 1000 years; and for a little ſeaſon. As concerning the opinion of many Worthyes, affirming, that the reign of the Saints a 1000 yeers, is to be expected in the glory of New-<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the end of the yeers of Antichriſt: I cannot poſſibly bring my judgement to incline unto it. For this opinion is incumbred with inextricable difficulties and uncouth aſſertions, as concerning a partiall reſurrection from the dead before the generall, and the like. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over alſo it hath not any ground from the place alledged in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as hath been ſhewed. And where New-<hi>Joruſalem</hi> is purpoſely deſcribed, there is not the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of ſuch a time determined, as being to be in a perpetuall uniformity eternall, after that it commeth to its height. And it is cleer from <hi>Daniel</hi> 12.1, 2, 11, 12, 13. and from <hi>Revelation</hi> 11.18. that the laſt judgement or Viall upon Antichriſt is to be compounded with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall reſurrection. For it is expreſſed to be the reſurrection, and none other followeth, <hi>Daniel</hi> 12.2. wherein both <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> and all that are wiſe and labour in the work of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall be glorified, Verſe 3, 13. and wherein all both ſmall and great ſhall be rewarded, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 11.18. Whereas it is objected, that New-<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, is deſcribed after ſuch a manner, as is ſutable to a temporall manner of reigning upon earth, according as
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:113414:76"/>the Millenary reigning is ſuppoſed to be. I conceive anſwer may be given unto this objection. For ſuch expreſſions of temporall felicity, as do occurre in the deſcription of New-<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> are either to be underſtood of its ſtate of <hi>inchea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as it is in <hi>motu;</hi> and eſpecially from after the end of the years of Antichriſt through the ſpace of 45 years, as <hi>Daniel</hi> expreſſeth, <hi>Daniel</hi> 12.11, 12. or being applied to its ſtate of heavenly perfection immediately enſuing, they are to be underſtood in a myſticall ſenſe, according to the common way and courſe of the holy Prophets. Who knoweth not, that New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and from whom the Pictures of it are tranſlated into the <hi>Revelation,</hi> are all along myſticall and figurative? And ſuch as are the deſcriptions in one prophet, ſuch for the generall muſt be the parallel deſcriptions in the reſt. There is Chriſt and the Church ſet forth by the building of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the worſhip of the Church by ſacrifices and feſtivall ſolemnities, Chriſt as King by the Prince or Princes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> glorified Saints by trees with healing leafes and fruits perpetuall, and their glorious inheritance by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall inheritances of the Sons of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Now I do acknowledge that theſe and the like places may have a generall application to the whole Kingdom of Chriſt, and more particularly to the firſt degrees of the Reformation after Antichriſt. But my purpoſe is not here to ſpeak of this larger acception. In a ſtricter ſenſe; the foreſaid paſſages are partly to be fulfilled in the ſtate of inchoation at the end of the reign of Antichriſt, and partly of the heavenly perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. So in the ſtate of inchoation the Miniſters as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, letting in the elect by converſion through the gates of particular Churches, into the community of the whole Church of New-<hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> ſhall hereby be inſtruments of bringing them into the heavenly perfection, and ſhall therein
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:113414:76"/>be glorified with their converts. And therefore in the ſtate of heavenly perfection, they are brought in under ſuch repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations as will agree to the foreſaid relation which they had unto their converts in the ſtate of inchoation, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 21.12. In like manner the Kings of the earth are ſaid to bring their glory unto it, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 21.24. according as in the parallel Prophecy, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 60. partly becauſe in its ſtate of inchoation they ſhall come unto it by converſion, ſubjecting themſelves, their Kingdoms and glory thereunto, in procuring the felicity thereof: and partly becauſe they ſhall ſtand in this frame of love unto Chriſt and his Church, through all eternities in heavenly perfection. Rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter running, Hills dropping new wine, Mountains flowing with milk, ſeven times increaſe of the light of the Sun, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Corn, and Feaſts and Dancings, and joyfull So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, to be expected when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be reſtored out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> are clearly Types and myſticall Expreſſions of the ſpirituall glory of the Church in generall, which is the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> when it ſhall be reduced out of the <hi>Babylon</hi> of Antichriſt in the ſtate of inchoation, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally when it ſhall aſcend unto the height of heavenly feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. The Church of converted Jews ſhall have their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> but to make it the onely thing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly intended in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> thus deſcribed, and in reſpect of temporall eſtate, I conceive is far beyond the intention of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                        <p>One paſſage in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> I will endeavour to clear, in ſtead of all other, by reaſon of the difficulty thereof. This is <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65.17, &amp;c. The ſtate of new Heavens and new Earth is there deſcribed, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. This largely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is the whole Kingdom of Chriſt, beginning at the times of the Apoſtles; wherein is ſpiritually old age, in reſpect of Grace, and duration, and proſperity, and ſecurity ſpirituall,

                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. and 92.12, 13, 14. But of this ſenſe I purpoſenet to ſpeak now. In a ſtricter acception, it is the ſtate of new Jeruſalem, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.1, 2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. that beginneth <hi>in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                           </hi> at the end of the years of Antichriſt, and is conſummate in coeleſtiall glory. Therein ſhall be no weeping, crying, &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 19. as <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 21.4. <hi>and there ſhall all be as old men, and none ſhall dye as yong men,</hi> verſe 20. becauſe there all ſhall be laſting, and alſo wiſe as old men, and fully know the Lord, and none ſhall be ſpirituall Infants any more. See <hi>Apoc.</hi> 4.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. For the deſcription of the Church is myſticall, after the ſimilitude of an earthly Kingdom, glorious in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall happineſſe, in which are no diſeaſes, Famine or Sword, to cut off the life before old age, and in which men build and plant, and labour cheerfully and ſucceſſively, enjoying the fruit of their labours without moleſtation or interruption, and wherein no enemy or wilde Beaſt maketh men afraid: So that by ſuch temporall felicity of long life, ſpirituall old age or wiſdom is partly ſignified, and partly perpetuall continuance in the Kingdom of Heaven. And as the Saints and Miniſters have builded ſpirituall houſes, and planted ſpirituall vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards in their own converſion, and the converſion of others, and in the ſetting up of Churches by the preaching of the Goſpel, after the ſimilitude of thoſe that in an earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do the ſame in temporall reſpects, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. ſo ſhall they eat the fruit, or enjoy the comfort hereof without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of any enemy, through all eternities. So <hi>verſe</hi> 21, 22, 23. And thus are the words following to be interpreted, <hi>verſe</hi> 24. <hi>Before they call I will hear:</hi> Becauſe, although they may literally be expounded of the inchoation of new Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, yet figuratively onely of the heavenly perfection, wherein God is ſaid to hear before we call, after the ſimilitude of temporall ſecurity, to ſignifie his continuall protection of his people from the very fears, or near approaches of any
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:113414:77"/>dangers. And whereas it is added, <hi>verſe</hi> 25. that <hi>The wolf and the lamb ſhall feed together, and the Serpent ſhall lick the duſt:</hi> Nothing elſe is ſignified, then an abſolute and eternall exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all enemies offenſive to the Church, partly by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion begun upon the Earth, and in Heaven continued, partly by perdition everlaſting. Laſtly, whereas in the time of the new Heavens and Earth, Levites and Prieſts are ſaid to continue, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 66.21, 22. Miniſters are underſtood in the ſtate of inchoation: and both in ſtate of inchoation and perfection, all Saints ſhall be myſticall Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites for ever, <hi>And they ſhall go forth and ſee the carcaſes of the wicked,</hi> that is, duly conſider the end of the wicked, whoſe worm ſhall never dye, and whoſe fire ſhall never go out, in the ſtate of Hell then oppoſite unto heavenly perfection. So <hi>chap.</hi> 66.24. compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44. It is clear from the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that under the Type of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was Heaven ſignified: And if in theſe and ſuch like expreſſions of the Prophers, Heaven is not underſtood, then would it not be ſpoken of by them, which would be utterly unreaſonable to think.</p>

                        <p>In the four firſt Vials, are onely ſet down four de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Judgement, and in the fourth degree coming to perfection: as appeareth by thoſe four degrees of judgement on the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, expreſſed by the like Figures, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 8.7.

Now the Popes Kingdom in propriety, though aſſailed for a little ſeaſon by the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> yet ſpeedily did not onely recover it ſelf in the foreſaid times, but alſo took occaſion by the Oppoſition to come unto its fulneſſe: wherein it alſo ſubſiſted untill the time of <hi>Wickcliff.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wherefore, from the yeer 1370, the time of <hi>Wickcliff,</hi> began the fifth Vial to be powred out upon the Throne and Kingdom of the Beaſt, in propriety ſo called. The ſixth followed from the time of <hi>Luther,</hi> whereby the waters of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the Rivers or Waters, that is, the Nations and Kingdoms of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſpiritual, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.15. effectually began to be dryed up: And the Proteſtant Princes politick, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Saints in general, as ſpiritual Kings and Princes, began openly and viſibly to reign, ſet up by Chriſt the Sun of Righteouſneſſe to ſhine upon the World, then ſitting in a night of darkneſſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſaid to come as it were from the riſing of the Sun. So the phraſe is to be interpreted, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7.2, 3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.1, 2, 3. and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Prophecies. This ſixth Vial runneth out in the laſt Aſcenſion of the Beaſt out of the bottomleſſe pit, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.17. and in the ſolution of the Dragon at the end of the 1000 yeers, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.3. For in the iſſue of the ſixth Vial, it is expreſſely ſaid in the ſame words for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that the Beaſt and Dragon went forth to gather the Kings of the Earth and of the whole World, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 16.13.14. That in their laſt proſperity for a little ſeaſon, they might be prepared for the laſt and great Vial, which ſhall expire and be compounded with the general Reſurrection and final Concluſion of all Judgement.</p>
                        <p>Now if the Vials begin from 620, then accordingly the ſixth Vial will end, and therewithall the 1000 yeers in 1620. From which time the Dragon ſhall gradually be looſed, firſt with various ſucceſſe, as the fifth Seal, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6.11. and the Hail-ſtone, ſpotted Horſes, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.6. do inſinuate, and then by three dayes and half of final Triumph, his ſolution ſhall run out in the yeer 1649, preciſely together with the 2260 yeers of Antichriſt, according to one of the two wayes of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation.</p>
                        <p>But if the Vials begin from 840, then accordingly the ſixth Vial will
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:113414:79"/>end, and therewithall the 1000 yeers, the ſpace of about 20 yeers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 1860; and ſo the ſolution of the Beaſt and Dragon, which is to be at the end of the 1000 yeers, will preciſely expire with the yeers of Antichriſt, according to the other way of Accommodation.</p>
                        <p>This is certain, that when theſe yeers ſhall have an end, immediately ſhall follow the glorious time of <hi>New-Jeruſalem,</hi> to the joy of all Saints: Whereof it is ſaid, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60.1. <hi>Ariſe O Jeruſalem and ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee.</hi> It is alſo very evident unto me, That this glory of <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> beginning at the end of the yeers of Antichriſt, is conſummated in Heavenly glory, as the utmoſt degree thereof: So that the Heavenly Eſtate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſe of the holy Prophets, entereth into the compoſition of <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the ſtate of new Heavens, and new Earth. For the ſtate of theſe new Heavens, and new Earth, promiſed in the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> is ſuch a ſtate wherein all Saints do expect their ſhare and portion Univerſally, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth expreſſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. And therefore it muſt neceſſarily be the ſtate of Heavenly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which is at leaſt incluſively ſpoken off by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> For thus go the words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13, 14. Nevertheleſſe we, that is, we all, all Saints and Chriſtians, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that is, as it is promiſed unto us in the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (which we have a little before Interpreted) do look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſſe, that is, all righteous people, and without defilement of ſin and ſinful ſociety. It followeth Verſ. 14. <hi>Wherefore Beloved, ſeeing that ye look for ſuch things, be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot and blameleſſe.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the general Reſurrection and laſt Judgement, are evidently brought in <hi>Apo.</hi> 20.11, 12. as the Expreſſions declare; So clear indeed, that any place of Scripture deſcribing the laſt Judgement, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted to another ſenſe as eaſily as this: And beſides, the Parallel place of <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2, 13, 14. doth confirm the ſame, where <hi>Daniel</hi> and all the wiſe, without Exception and Diſtinction, are brought in partakers of the Reſurrection, at the end of the laſt plague upon Antichriſtians. Now the perfect ſtate of <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> is expreſſely brought in after this general Reſurrection and laſt Judgement, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.11. and 21.1. And therefore it is the ſtate of heavenly perfection. As the old Heavens and Earth, do gradually go away from after the end of the yeers of Antichriſt; that is, as the Antichriſtian Kingdoms do gradually depart, ſo the new Heavens, and new Earth, or Kingdom of Chriſt, with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:113414:79"/>the change of all things, doth gradually come in: Until at the end of 45 yeers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.12. the old Heavens, and old Earth being perfectly departed in the laſt Judgement and general Reſurrection, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.11. the new Heavens, and the new Earth, come into the place thereof, in the ſtate of heavenly and immutable Perfections. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.1, 2.</p>
                        <p>In the foreſaid incoactive ſtate of <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> the Jews ſhall come in by Converſion, according to the Prophecy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. and ſhall be principal Members, and extraordinarily gifted for the enlarging of the Kingdom of Chriſt, over all the World. They began firſt to run as <hi>Cuſhi,</hi> but interrupted. The Gentile Chriſtians, like <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> break over the Mountains of oppoſition, God making all Hills as a plane unto them: And ſo they firſt bring in the tydings of the fall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. But the tydings are general and incompleat. Afterward,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.31.</note> the Jews that firſt began to run, ſhall come in laſt, and bring diſtinct and perfect tydings of the fall of Antichriſt, and all enemies univerſally. Now when they have ſo done, then ſhall follow life from the dead, or the general Reſurrection, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. So then the Jews ſhall come in as Members of <hi>New Jeruſalem:</hi> and <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is to be the Catholike Church, advanced to the ſtate of glory, wherein there is no diſtinction of Jew or Gentile, Grecian or Barbarian. And therefore in all the <hi>Revelation,</hi> I finde not any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jewiſh Chriſtians in diſtinction from the reſt. The Jews are the faithful in general, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.9. and ſo are the Jews of <hi>Philadelphia, Apoc.</hi> 3.9. The twelve Tribes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are all the parts of Chriſtendom, out of which, the Saints are ſealed, before the glorious time of <hi>New Jeruſalem, Apoc.</hi> 7.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The Holy City or <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is Chriſtendom, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.2. And the Kings of the Eaſt, may be the Proteſtants in general, as hath been Expounded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of Holy Scripture. So is <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> the Catholike Church glorified, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. And it is a name impoſed on the Gentile <hi>Philadelphia, Apoc.</hi> 3.12. The true Church in general is called the <hi>Jeruſalem, Gal.</hi> 4.26. And all that is called <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Old Teſtament, unto whom the Promiſes are made, are not <hi>Iſrael</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh, but myſtical <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the whole Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo in all his Prophecies, by his people, and by his holy people, underſtandeth Chriſtians in general, as hath been ſhewed before. See <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. and 11.45. and 12.1. Accordingly in all the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, although the Prophecies are litterally to be underſtood of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> properly ſo called according to the Type, yet according to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:113414:80"/>the Antitype, and more fully, they appertain to the myſtical <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and myſtical <hi>Judah,</hi> the Catholike Church of Chriſt, and eſpecially as riſing out of the myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> of Antichriſt, as the parallel places in the <hi>Revelation</hi> do evidently declare.
<note place="margin">Revel. 14.8. and 18.2, 3, 12, 20, 21, 22. and 19.2.</note> But of this I purpoſed onely at this time to give a hint, as alſo to touch a few Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the way: And I have been much larger, then I thought to be. Much more ſatisfaction may be given concerning theſe things, and if neceſſity require, and ſtrength, and opportunity make way, I hope I ſhould not be backward to do my beſt ſervice herein to the Spouſe of Chriſt. If any of my Reverend Brethren, otherwiſe minded, can ſhew unto me better light, I ſhall count my ſelf and the Church of God beholding unto them for it, and willingly receive it at their hands. In the mean time, this is my judgement.</p>
